(Refer to appendix 1 for details). National Food Safety Policy MINISTRY OF HEALTH VI FOREWORD Food safety has been described as protecting the food supply from microbial, chemical and physical hazards that may occur during all stages of food production, including growing, harvesting, processing, transporting, retailing, distributing, preparing, storing and consumption. When food safety systems are well developed, they contribute to improved public health, nutrition, enhance access to food trade, reduction of poverty, increased food security and the protection of the environment. There is increasing global interest in the safety of foods available for consumption. This interest has been heightened in the wake of the numerous food scares which have been experienced globally. To address these concerns, national and international strategies have been put in place to provide the requisite information, standards and regulations to ensure that consumers get the best value for health and nutrition. The Government of Ghana is also increasing awareness, with the public and private sectors as well as international agencies showing support and commitment to improve the food safety situation in the country. There has been a multiplicity of programmes instituted by institutions who contribute to ensuring that the foods consumed by Ghanaians are safe and of good quality. These programmes and actions are so far not driven by any"}

The Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with relevant Ministries, Departments, Agencies (including the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ministry of Trade and Industries, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology and Innovations, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Ministry of Education, National Development Planning Commission) and other partners have prepared this Food Safety Policy for Ghana with the ultimate aim of establishing and maintaining an integrated farm to fork food safety system that ensures consumer health and public safety. MINISTRY OF HEALTH National Food Safety Policy VII This policy is being developed from a situation analysis report titled Food Safety in Ghana A Situational Analysis. The specific objectives of the assessment were to analyze the food safety situation in Ghana and make recommendations for the development of a National Food Safety Policy taking into account current and previous initiatives and programmes. The Situational Analysis report was validated by stakeholders at a couple of workshops. The policy has also been produced through a consultative process which included a stakeholder policy formulation workshop. The adoption and implementation of this National Food Safety Policy is expected to reduce the incidence of food borne diseases in the country. The National Food Safety Policy will also provide a basis for the establishment of National Food Safety objectives, requirements and guidance for application to specific sectors of the food chain, that is, from farm to fork. Through the adoption and promulgation of this Policy, the Government of Ghana reaffirms its commitment to fulfilling the constitutional obligation of ensuring safer and better nutrition for its population.

National Food Safety Policy MINISTRY OF HEALTH 1 1.0 INTRODUCTION Background Foodborne illnesses are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and a significant impediment to socioeconomic development worldwide. Furthermore, outbreaks of foodborne illness can damage trade and tourism, and lead to loss of earnings, unemployment and litigation (Codex GPFH, 1969). The food chain has significantly evolved with advances in technologies and equipment for food manufacturing, storage and distribution. Eating habits have also undergone significant changes with efforts to make seasonal foods available all year round. Varieties of nontraditional foods and processed food are also being constantly moved from one region/country to another. International food trade and travel are increasing, bringing important social and economic benefits. However, this also makes the spread of illness around the world easier. The types, severity and impacts of these illnesses have changed through the ages and are still diverse across regions, countries and communities. According to WHO in 2010, about 600 million foodborne illnesses and 420,000 deaths were recorded across the globe. In the African region alone, WHO estimates that more than 91 million foodborne illnesses and 137,000 deaths occurred representing one third of the global death toll. Diarrhoea diseases was the 4th cause (7% of total cases) of morbidity among the top twenty causes of Outpatient Morbidity in Ghana in 2016 (GHS- Ghana Health Facts and Figures, 2017). According to the IHME Country profile on Global Burden of Diseases for Ghana"}
{"source_file": "NFSP-Document-signed-and-launched.pdf", "chunk_id": "NFSP-Document-signed-and-launched_8", "text": "in 2017, diarrhea diseases rank 8th on what causes the most deaths in Ghana and 1.4% of deaths were due to diarrheal diseases of which foodborne and waterborne diseases are part. In most cases only a fraction of the people who become sick from eating contaminated food seek medical care or report to public health authorities and are recorded in official disease statistics. Certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, kidney or liver failure, that result from contaminated food appear long after the ingestion of food and the causal link is never made for each case. MINISTRY OF HEALTH National Food Safety Policy 2 Safer food saves lives. With every intake of food, one is potentially exposed to illness from either microbiological or chemical contamination. When a functional food safety system is in place, they contribute to improved public health, increased access to food trade, reduction of poverty, increased food security and the protection of the environment, enhanced productivity and above all, national development. Consequently, everyone, including primary producers, importers, manufacturers, processors, food warehouse/logistics operators, food handlers, retailers, and consumers, has a responsibility to ensure that food is safe and suitable for consumption. In Ghana, there are major concerns and gaps that currently exist with regard to national food safety. There are food safety issues with regard to food production, handling, packaging, processing and transportation. There are also multiplicities of regulators within the food value chain, whose activities are largely uncoordinated. As Ghana seeks to improve her competitiveness on the global markets, there is the need to review how agri-business (from production to consumption) is conducted especially as it relates to quality and risk analysis in the country. All operators in the food chain need to have capacities to assure food quality and safety to the consumer. There is increasing global"}

To address these concerns, national and international strategies need to be put in place to provide information, standards and regulations to ensure that consumers get the best value for health and nutrition. Hence the need for the development of a National Food Safety Policy. 1.1.1 Situational Analysis An overview of the country\u2019s food safety situation reveals major challenges that exist along the food value chain (farm to fork). These problems have been identified and discussed below: (a) Food Production and Food Safety The major food safety challenges associated with food production include chemical and microbial contamination of foods; poor harvesting and drying systems for grains resulting in the production and accumulation of fungal toxins; poor handling and packaging of fresh produce at the National Food Safety Policy MINISTRY OF HEALTH 3 farm level and local markets. In addition, some studies have noted that Ghana, like other African countries, has high incidence of food and water-related diseases due to microbial and chemical contamination (b) The food value chain The food value chain consists of a sequence of activities including production, harvesting, handling, packaging, transportation, marketing, distribution, processing and consumption. The Ghanaian food value chain is dominated by the informal sector which plays a major role in food delivery to the various end users and is involved in activities in food production, food trade, food processing, food distribution and marketing. From available studies12, some of the challenges faced by the informal sector include lack of potable water and contaminated receptacles for holding water for street vending operations, leading to several infections like leptospirosis, Clostridium perfringes gastroenteritis, cryptosporidiosis, diarrhea etc. Meat from unlicensed sources may expose the consumers to anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, trichinellosis and taeniasis. In addition, there are different types"}

Agricultural marketing in Ghana includes sale at: farm-gates, roadside /open markets; purpose-built markets with stalls; container/kiosk selling points; table-top and itinerant traders. They handle a wide range of food commodities in the form of raw, semi-processed and finished goods. For some commodities there is an intricate network of actors and activities which are generally not regulated, and it is difficult to trace the source of material being offered for sale. Some activities at the market can however be an important source of food contamination which can compromise food safety and health. Exposure of produce to unfavorable storage conditions; poor hygienic conditions for food marketing, processing and consumption can all contribute to challenges in food safety.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH National Food Safety Policy 4 There are also challenges with the safety and quality of food items imported and exported. Other problems relate to food safety research, safety and control of genetically modified organisms and foods, inspection of food products and plants, all of which need to be addressed in a holistic manner. (d) Training in food safety Training for professionals in food safety is offered in different institutions some of which are not accredited. In addition, there is no system for overall coordination to ensure that training in food safety management systems are properly regulated. The"}

Guidelines should be developed for the training institutions and industry. (e) Public and Consumer Education Consumer and public education is identified as being important in the safe handling of food, whether processed or unprocessed. There are concerns with street vending of food in unsanitary conditions exposing consumers to food safety hazards with serious health implications. Various educational programmes are mounted by organizations (Food and Drugs Authority, Ghana Standards Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Ministry of Food and Agriculture etc) to educate consumers and operators, but there are still challenges in this area due to lack of coordination. (f) Laboratories and Surveillance With regard to food control laboratories and surveillance, it was noted that there are laboratories with the capacity to analyze foods and other products in support of a food safety system. Most of these are in the public-sector institutions. Specialized laboratories are present under the Food and Drugs Authority, Food Research Institute, Ghana Standards Authority, Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate, and Veterinary Services Directorate. The Food and Drugs Authority, Food Research Institute and Ghana Standards Authority have laboratories accredited to IS017025: General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. There are also private sector laboratories that are mostly concerned with health and medical laboratory services. Ghana has a disease surveillance system that does not segregate food-borne disease to effectively inform the managers of National Food Safety Policy MINISTRY OF HEALTH 5 food safety. Three key ministries with agencies or institutions directly involved in monitoring and surveillance of foodborne diseases are the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) Ministry of fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MOFAD). Under these three Ministries are"}

Under the MOH is the Disease Surveillance Department of the Ghana Health Service and the National Disease Surveillance Unit that was set up under the Public Health Directorate of the Ghana Health Service to coordinate and implement integrated surveillance activities in the country. Under MOFA and MOFAD are the Veterinary Service Directorate (VSD) and Fisheries Commission respectively, which coordinate and implement food-borne disease surveillance in animals. MOFA serves as a World Trade Organisation (WTO) focal points. Surveillance is also dependent upon the records of physicians and clinical laboratories. Reports on diseases and specific diagnosed infections in hospitals and clinics all over the country also contribute to the surveillance programmes. (g) Biosafety issues In recent years, Ghana is faced with the challenge of making substantial progress in food security due to the stagnant emergence of average yields. Food production continues to fluctuate from year to year because of the recent variations in the magnitude of rains during and between growing seasons, thereby destroying crops and livestock. This is a growing phenomenon that is also being experienced by other countries around the globe. Food biotechnology which focuses on the modification of genes of food sources such as plants, animals and microorganisms is aimed at improving food quantity and quality. However, since the first commercialization of biotechnology crops in 1996, some international and local food activists have raised uncertainty about whether or not biotechnology crops are as safe as conventional crops. This has seen the development of guidelines by some international organizations to ensure the safety of biotechnology in food production. In Ghana, the National Biosafety Act 2011 (Act 831) has been passed to regulate biotechnology activities in the country. However, the range of activities envisaged"}

MINISTRY OF HEALTH National Food Safety Policy 6 (h) Environmental Pollution and Food Safety The contamination of food of either plant or animal origin with different pollutants is a major problem in many countries including Ghana. A recent research by International POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutant) Elimination Network. (IPEN) and Basel Action Network (BAN) revealed high toxic chemicals in eggs and blood streams of animals straying and feeding at Agbogbloshie in Accra due to high pollution levels and Persistent Organic pollutants (POPs) in the soil and atmosphere The menace of plastic pollution which finds its way into water bodies and aquatic life in the sea also results in ingestion of micro or nano plastics by fishes which finds its way into the bloodstream of humans when we consume them. Environmental pollution thus presents a great risk to food safety and therefore requires an utmost attention through the active involvement of the citizenry in maintaining clean and safe environment, strong advocacy and effective implementation of environmental protection and sanitation related policy and regulatory frameworks. i. Legislative framework on food safety Ghana has several pieces of legislation on food safety including: legislation governing food and drugs, standards, veterinary services pests\u2019 control and plant protection. 1.1.2 Need for A National Food Safety Policy The situational analysis on food safety revealed fragmented roles and poorly coordinated institutions in respect of food safety activities. However; there is great potential to harness their collective skills and strengths. It is recommended that a new organizational framework, which delineates core responsibilities should be developed. This will require Ministries, Departments and Agencies and other public and"}

The policy shall recognise national, regional and international practices, principles, guidelines, standards and agreements National Food Safety Policy MINISTRY OF HEALTH 7 governing food safety systems. It applies to all stakeholders involved in the food continuum: production, processing, storage, transportation and marketing. 1.3 Process of preparing the policy A multi-stakeholder task team was setup to oversee the process of assessing the food safety situation in Ghana. Consultants were engaged to undertake a situational analysis on food safety with recommendation for drafting the National Food Safety Policy which was reviewed by major stakeholders. A National Food Safety Policy Committee was then set- up to engage a consultant and oversee the preparation of the National Food Safety Policy. A draft National Food Safety Policy including a strategic Action Plan for implementation was developed and submitted to series of stakeholder consultations for validation. 1.4 Content and Structure The previous section (Chapter One) outlines the problem statement for the policy and summarises some of the key findings from the situational analysis under take non-food safety and is followed by a look at the policy context in Chapter Two. The policy framework which includes the policy objectives, guiding principles and policy measures follows in Chapter Three.

This policy and guidelines seeks to ensure that HCW is managed effectively in compliance with existing laws and regulations and others to be passed in future The recommendations for better management of the healthcare wastes in the nation\u2019s health care facilities have been presented in detail as a guide for facilities at various levels of the health care system. It is envisaged that this will enable health practitioners both in the public and private health sub- sectors to understand the various activities required to be carried out. Health and safety concerns and guidance have been addressed as part of this policy and guidelines to ensure that managements of institutions put in place measures to limit exposure of their staff and the general public to the hazardous components of health care waste. It is hoped that provision will be made for the supply of all necessary personal protective equipment and their use enforced during the performance of all activities that potentially generate infectious waste as well as those that go into the handling of such waste. The need for training and the monitoring of the healthcare waste management system have been outlined in order for the management at the facilities to enhance common knowledge of safe healthcare waste management and in order to evaluate their management practices during"}

This policy document is the outcome of a collaborative effort between health personnel and personnel of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and the Environmental Protection Agency among others. It is therefore hoped that this collaboration will be enhanced in the implementation of these guidelines with each organization playing its rightful role in order to give the necessary impetus to ensure proper management of Health Care Waste in Ghana.

Etiologic Agents: Organisms or other agents that cause a particular disease Hazardous Waste: Waste that can have a significant adverse effect on public health and/or the environment due to its infectiousness, toxicity, corrosiveness, carcinogenicity or other properties. Health Care Waste: All untreated solid and liquid waste (both hazardous and non- hazardous) generated during the administration of medical care, veterinary care or the performance of medical research involving humans and animals. These include infectious, pathological, radioactive, pharmaceutical and other hazardous wastes. Infectious Waste: Waste containing pathogenic organisms like bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi in sufficient quantities to cause disease in susceptible hosts. Pathogens: Disease causing agents Pathological Waste: Tissues, organs, body parts, foetuses, etc. that have the potential to be infectious and are therefore sometimes classified as a subcategory of infectious wastes. Sharps Container: Puncture resistant waste container used for disposal of needles and associated syringes. Sharps: All items that pose a risk of injury and infection due to their puncture and cutting properties e.g. needles, scalpels, knives, glass, syringes, pipettes and similar items having a point or sharp edge or that are likely to break during transportation and result in a pointed or sharp edge. 1 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 The Nature of Problems of Health Care Waste The provision of health care, like any other human activity, generates waste which has to be managed and disposed of in a safe manner in order to minimize risks it poses to the health of health workers, clients and the community at large."}
{"source_file": "Health-Care-Waste-Management-Policy-and-Guidelines.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Care-Waste-Management-Policy-and-Guidelines_5", "text": "The greater part of waste generated by health institutions is not hazardous and can be managed like household waste. This constitutes about 75% to 90% of all waste generated in health institutions. However, the remaining10% to 25 % is hazardous and requires special arrangements for management. Examples of hazardous health care waste are pathological waste such as tissues and body fluid, pharmaceuticals e.g. expired or unused drugs, sharps (syringes, disposable scalpels, blades, etc.), non sharps (swabs, bandages, disposable medical devices, etc) and chemicals (solvents, disinfectants, etc.), as well as waste water including effluents from mortuaries. These pose risks by being infectious, toxic, radioactive or causing injuries. In 1992, the Waste Management Department of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly conducted a study in 6 major hospitals in Accra which showed the unit generation of health care waste to be 1.2 kg/bed/day. This is likely to be increasing due to an increasing number of hospital beds and improved standards of living. With a bedstate of 4,372 in Accra in 2002 (does not include all private facilities) and an occupancy rate of 99%, it is estimated that waste generated per day is over 5.2 tons daily. This translates to over 1,850 tons of health care waste annually, over 330 tons of which could be hazardous, assuming 18% of waste generated is of hazardous nature. The study also found that the waste generated vary in proportion to the level of complexity and specialized functions performed, the population of in- and out- patients and the number of auxiliary departments within the facility e.g. radiology, laboratory, research, etc. Thus the quantities of waste generated were found to be high in the teaching, regional and district hospitals as compared to private clinics, health centres and health posts. Currently, there is no sector-wide waste management system in place, with"}

There is also no valid monitoring mechanism to verify compliance to agreed norms and practices. A survey carried out in 2001 to assess health care waste management in health facilities in Ghana showed that waste management practices were below acceptable standards and posed risk to staff and communities. Key findings of that survey include: i. Absence of a national policy and guidelines and standard operating procedures ii. Different systems in place for waste segregation iii. No colour coding in place and wastes were not labelled; iv. Containers for waste were unacceptable and not standardized. v. Vehicles for transporting waste were inadequate; vi. Storage sites for waste within the facilities were open, accessible to unauthorised persons and animals, breeding grounds for flies, rodents and other insects; vii. Final disposal of waste was unacceptable; burying, open burning, in some cases infectious waste was dumped on open grounds. 2 As a result of some education on proper collection and storage and the introduction of the Demontfort incinerators in district hospitals, this situation is improving. An inventory of potential emission of dioxins and furans from incinerator use conducted by the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) in 2004 showed the potential for levels of these substances to be higher than comparable parameters in Europe in the mid 1980s. Though no maximum exposure limit has been set for these chemicals, in view of the substantial health risk from exposure to them, the objective as spelt out in the Stockholm Convention (2001), which Ghana has ratified, is to reduce them to the lowest possible level. Widespread expansion in incinerator use is likely to result in much higher levels of emissions. This combined with emissions"}

The study therefore proposed that the long-term objective should be to limit the number of incinerators used to a few high capacity ones which (if acquired) should be fitted with APC systems that meet international standards. These could be shared among districts/regions. In view of the difficulties in transportation from small peripheral facilities, the aim at this level should be to improve the operation of the De Monfort and other locally made brick incinerators in these areas. This could be achieved through attaining correct temperatures in the incineration chambers and chimneys through pre-heating and avoiding the overloading of the incinerator with waste. The use of LPG gas for preheating where firewood is difficult to find could also be considered. Secondly, the introduction of other environmentally friendly treatment options such as micro wave systems and waste autoclaves should be considered alongside state of the art incinerators. In order to address these shortfalls, the Ministry of Health set up a working group made up of stakeholders in the sector, both public and private to develop policy and guidelines for managing health care waste. 1.2 The Policy and Legal Context Waste management in Ghana is a multi-sectoral effort with the Ministry of Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency playing key roles as implementer and regulator respectively. This responsibility is discharged through the District, Municipal and Metropolitan assemblies which are directly under the Ministry of Local Government on the one hand and the offices of the Environmental Protection Agency on the other. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that waste is disposed of, however, lies with the person or institution that generates the 3 waste in line with the principle of \u2018the polluter pays\u2019.

Existing laws and policies assign certain functions to some institutions such as district assemblies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through EPA Act 490 (1994) and the National Sanitation Policy (1999) but lacks specific provisions for dealing with health care waste in a comprehensive manner. The Sanitation Policy calls for institutional measures for collection of the waste while the Buildings Regulation states that hazardous and domestic refuse shall be treated separately. This situation leaves room for the performance of the function to fall through the cracks. The current policy builds on the guidelines for management of health care and veterinary waste whose development was led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2002. Some of the laws that have relevance for Health Care Waste Management include: \uf0a7 The Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992 \uf0a7 The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1994 (Act 490) \uf0a7 Environmental Assessment Regulations, 1999 (LI 1652) \uf0a7 The Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) \uf0a7 National Building Regulations, 1996 (LI 1630) \uf0a7 Town and Country Planning Ordinances, 1944 (Cap 84) \uf0a7 Vaccination Ordinance Cap 76 \uf0a7 Quarantine Ordinance Cap 77 \uf0a7 Mosquito Ordinance Cap 75 \uf0a7 Infectious Disease Ordinance \uf0a7 Food and Drugs Law 305b (1992) \uf0a7 Mortuaries and Funeral Facilities Act, 1998 (Act 563) \uf0a7 The Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) The Constitution of Ghana enshrines the human rights of the individual and requires the President to report to Parliament at"}

Section 41 of the Constitution lists certain duties and responsibilities associated with the exercise and enjoyment of rights and freedoms, among which is the duty to protect and safeguard the environment. The Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) 296(1) provides that whoever places or permits to be placed, any carrion, filth, dirt, refuse, or rubbish, or any offensive or otherwise unwholesome matter, on any street, yard, enclosure, or open space, except at such places as may be set apart by the local 4 authority or health officer for that purpose commits a punishable offence. The code went further in section 297 (1), to state that when an offence has been committed under section 296 (1) but the offender has not been identified or discovered, the fact of any carrion or other substance mentioned in that subsection being found in front of any premises shall be prima facie evidence of its having been placed there by the occupier of the premises. By going to this extreme, the law seeks to ensure that residents take responsibility for the streets in front of them as well as their premises. There are similar provisions in the other laws cited above.

SCOPE OF POLICY 2.1 Objectives of the Policy The policy seeks to ensure that health care waste is managed effectively in compliance with existing laws and regulations and others to be passed in future in order to protect health care workers, their clients (patients, caregivers and visitors) and the environment from potentially disease-causing waste materials. The Guidelines provide standards, procedures and processes for handling health care waste in the sector institutions and mechanisms for performance and performance monitoring. 2.2 Scope of the Policy The Policy and Guidelines apply primarily to all health institutions whether public, private, quasi- governmental, non-governmental or faith-based, that operate in the country at all levels: Tertiary/Teaching/Specialist Hospitals, Regional Hospitals, District Hospitals and Subdistrict Health Institutions i.e. Health Centres/Clinics and Community Clinics. Health Research Institutions, Laboratories, Alternative Health Care Providers, (including traditional healers and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs). Mortuaries, Funeral Homes and Undertakers, Pharmacies and Chemists are also included. The principles outlined are equally applicable to situations of home based care for persons infected with HIV/AIDS and other ailments as well as those in the \u201cservice industry\u201d which encompasses Traditional Birth Attendants, \u201cWanzams\u201d, Barbers, Hairdressers etc. Whilst reference may be made to general domestic waste generated by these institutions, the focus of the Policy and Guidelines is health care waste that is considered hazardous.

Since there are a lot more health facilities in the urban areas, centralisation of treatment facilities such as incinerators and autoclaves is practicable. (Rural and peri-urban areas would for the time being continue to make use of the decentralised system of incineration.) This will require a support transport system that is efficient and poses minimal risk to the environment. v. Efforts shall be made to select treatment options which pose minimal risk to the environment within the limits imposed by available financial, human and technical resources. 7 vi. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will collaborate with the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD), District Assemblies, corporate and individual employers within the health sector as well as all other stakeholders to ensure an effective management of health care waste. vii.

These include infectious (including pathological and sharps) radioactive, pharmaceutical and other hazardous wastes as well as general waste. Generally, between 75-90% of the waste produced by health-care providers is non-risk or \u201cgeneral\u201d health-care waste, comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 10-25% of health care waste is regarded as hazardous. These guidelines therefore identify two broad categories of health care waste. These are: i. General or non-hazardous waste not contaminated with blood, body fluids, or other harmful agents or materials (also referred to as domestic or municipal wastes) such as paper, fabrics, glass, food residues and containers; ii. Wastes considered hazardous due to their potential for creating a variety of health risks as a result of their actual or presumed biological, chemical and/or radioactive contamination.

It is not harmful except for the fact that it is produced within the hospital environment and therefore requires special handling. It includes sweepings from lawns, corridors, offices, workshop, stores, waste from kitchen, etc. \uf0a7 Paper, cardboard, plastic materials including those from points of generation, kitchen waste, ash, sawdust, pieces of wood etc. B INFECTIOUS WASTE These types of waste from the hospital have physical and chemical characteristics similar to those of industrial hazardous waste and waste generated by both in-patients/out- patients or animals which is likely to contain pathogenic micro-organisms. It includes materials that can be infectious to patients, health care workers and the public. It therefore requires special management both inside and outside the hospital until it is finally disposed of. This may further be classified under the following sub classification: \uf0a7 Laboratory waste generated by microbiological investigation. \uf0a7 Potentially infected blood and human and animal tissue. (e.g. HIV) 1 SHARPS These are sharp-edged wastes with puncture and/or cutting properties that pose risk of injury and infection. They may be stained or contaminated with blood or body fluids from injection rooms, surgical equipment etc. \uf0a7 Needles, syringes, surgical blades, scalpels, test tubes, ampoules, glass instruments, pipettes etc 2 PATIENT WASTE/ CULTURE/ SPECIMEN These are wastes generated from in- or out-patient activities and may be contaminated or stained with blood or body fluids from surgical"}

All these stages take place within the facility and are followed by transportation to a treatment plant, (on or off-site) and final disposal. 11 The stages in HCWM are summarized in figure 1. In each institution, the head of the facility must ensure that the steps are followed to ensure adequate collection and disposal of the health care wastes. Furthermore, microplanning should be carried out starting from the facility and subdistrict level upwards to the regional level to ensure the most cost-effective means of collecting, transporting, treating and final disposal of the waste. HCWM is most effective when proper methods are employed at each step whilst bearing in mind the following considerations: i. The nature of waste, level of toxicity and risk to health. ii. Legal - the prevailing regulations (on health and environment) iii. Financial \u2013 investment and running costs as against the facility\u2019s/district\u2019s /region\u2019s budget. iv. Technical \u2013 technologies available on the market and existing options in the sub- region. v. Patient load/quantity of waste generated daily vi. Sustainability \u2013 viewed alongside the availability of energy sources and other utilities to run equipment. vii. Local community preferences \u2013 whilst some communities may have an aversion for some treatment options available"}

For whatever approved reasons treatment options are chosen by a locality, health care institutions and waste management companies shall ensure that safety and efficiency are not compromised. 4.2.2 Segregation and Containment of Waste The following guidelines shall apply to waste segregation and containment: i. Different type of waste requires different method of handling, treatment and disposal. Therefore, it is important that health care waste is segregated into the various sub-categories for safety reasons and to facilitate minimization as well as application of appropriate treatment and disposal methods Appropriate handling, treatment and disposal of waste by sub-category will help to reduce costs as the type of waste influences the disposal method used, hence disposal costs. Non- segregation of the waste renders all clinical waste generated infectious or hazardous and results in higher management costs. ii. Segregation should be at source; that is it should take place as close as possible to the point of generation of the waste and should always be the responsibility of the waste producer. iii. Each waste stream segregated must be placed in an appropriately colour-coded container as shown in Table 2. iv. Instruction posters regarding the procedure for waste segregation should be pasted in all areas where segregation takes place and other vantage points. v. For effective planning, each level of"}

This includes all wastes generated during clinical care (including surgery), routine and mass immunization. The estimates should be collated by the DHMT in each district to obtain the district waste generated and further, by the RHMT to estimate regional level waste generation. Each region should then submit returns on these levels quarterly to GHS headquarters. vi. Health institutions shall ensure that every waste they generate and pass on to a transporter or waste management company to be transported for treatment/disposal is accompanied by a signed statement certifying that the waste has been properly segregated, stored and/or treated (as applicable) in accordance with this policy and guidelines and no longer constitutes a hazard. In cases where institution lacks the facility to treat and therefore hands in untreated waste, the certificate shall disclose this fact. There shall be affixed to every waste a label which indicates the classification, the processes it has gone through and the initials of the officer(s) who processed it. vii. All health institutions shall recruit and train health care waste management officers and ensure that they are well equipped to handle health care waste. Health care waste management training should be incorporated/ strengthened in both pre- service and in-service training of health personnel. This training notwithstanding, where it is preferred to do so for reasons of cost, efficiency, or other reasons the management function may be outsourced to a duly certified waste management company. 13 viii. The teaching hospital and GHS should submit their returns to the MOH or an appropriate body or department designated by the MOH, which should further collate the statistics into a composite estimate of the national health care waste.

The recommended colour coding scheme for Ghana (adapted from WHO) is as follows: BLACK General waste (e.g. kitchen waste, paper, cardboard, sweeping etc) YELLOW - Infectious waste (e.g. sharps, patient waste, human/animal tissue and cultures/specimens) with the biohazard label - Radioactive waste with the radioactive symbol. BROWN Hazardous waste (e.g. expired drugs, vaccines, chemicals etc). Where only small amounts of chemical wastes are generated, these may be added to the infectious waste. Some variations to this arrangement may occur based on treatment options used in particular locations, which will also influence the level of segregation.

Protected pits (final disposal of sludge) District hospitals and health centres in rural areas, regional hospitals 4.6 Waste Minimization Health facilities must aim at reducing the impact of health care risk waste in their operations by minimizing the generation of health care risk waste at source and, to a lesser extent, recycling. This may be achieved through the following measures: \uf0a7 Keeping individual waste streams segregated, thereby keeping hazardous waste segregated from the non-hazardous. \uf0a7 Improving inventory control by using up old stocks of drugs and chemicals before using new stock and ordering hazardous chemicals only when needed and in minimal quantities to avoid outdated inventory. \uf0a7 Co-operating with other facilities by exchanging drugs and pharmaceuticals getting close to their expiry dates \uf0a7 Recycling of general wastes such as uncontaminated card board, paper, glass and plastic. Where there is risk of contamination with infectious agents, these items must be regarded as infectious and handled as such. Consideration should be given to recycling as much waste as possible in instances where this does not increase health risks or costs e.g. recycling of uncontaminated cardboard boxes and waste paper. 4.7 Waste Water Treatment and Disposal Waste water from Health Care facilities is of similar quality to urban waste water, but may also contain various potentially hazardous components. Table 5: Recommended Treatment and Disposal Equipment 28 Hazardous components of waste water from Health Care Facilities include the following: i. Bacteria, viruses"}

Hazardous chemicals from cleaning and disinfection operations. iii. Pharmaceuticals from pharmacies and various wards. iv. Radioactive isotopes. Waste in categories ii, iii and iv must be segregated and treated appropriately. Waste water in category i and other general liquid effluents should be connected to the sewerage system if available, or to other technically sound on-site systems. However, during epidemics or where highly infectious patients are involved, high risk type wastes should be pre-treated by chemical disinfection before disposal. The use of biodigesters is an option for treatment of waste water from toilets and latrines. Waste water from kitchens and biodegradable potentially infectious waste can also be handled via this means. It is however not advisable to treat other infectious waste by this method. The biogas (methane) produced may be used in kitchen appliances (stoves and refrigerators). The recommended treatment option for many chemical wastes such as cytotoxic drugs, vaccines and acid waste from the laboratory is high temperature incineration. Currently, there is no treatment facility for such wastes. For the long term, efforts will be made to acquire at least one suitable incinerator for their treatment. Until then, disposal of liquid chemical wastes will comprise dilution with large volumes of water, neutralization (where indicated) and washing down the drain. Chemical decontamination is to be used for organic substances and solvents. 4.8 Spillage Procedures Whilst all efforts should be made to avoid loss or spillage of any kind, in the event of the latter occurring, a clear procedure must be followed. A ready supply of all necessary equipment must be in place for use whenever such an event occurs. It is important that information and training for staff is provided prior to any such eventuality. The aim of a spillage"}

Limit the escape iii. Protect staff, patients and visitors iv. Protect the environment v. Restore the area to normalcy as quickly as possible. vi. Minimize the effect of the spillage on normal service provision. 4.8.1 Procedure for Handling Spillage of Clinical Waste 29 The main risk is that of cross infection, and the procedure consists of donning protective clothing consistent with the risk, in most cases disposable gloves, and apron if appropriate, and placing the waste items into the appropriate yellow bag; or into a sharps box in the case of needles, blades or other sharp items, taking special care not to receive a sharps injury. Sharps must not be retrieved by hand. The following guidelines shall therefore apply: i. Staff cleaning spills shall wear protective clothing suitable for the spillage at hand. ii. Standard cleaning equipment including a mop and cleaning bucket plus cleaning agents shall be readily available for spills management and shall be stored and sign- posted in an area known to all staff. iii. The procedure for spill management will depend on the following: \uf0a7 Nature of the spill, e.g. blood, urine and faeces. \uf0a7 Possible pathogens that may be involved. \uf0a7 Size of the spill i.e. spot, splash, puddle, large spill. \uf0a7 Type of surface involved i.e. linoleum, carpet, wood, laminated, etc. \uf0a7 Area involved i.e. preparatory laboratory, teaching, common access areas, etc. \uf0a7 Likelihood of bare skin contact with the soiled area. iv. For a small spill, disinfect using a disinfectant cleaning solution preferably chlorine based such as Bleach and clean. v. For a large spill, flood with the disinfectant, mop and clean the area with disinfectant cleaning solution using a mop and allow to air dry or where available, with absorbent paper which is then"}

Large spills of cultures or concentrated infectious agents shall also be flooded with high-level disinfectant (germicide like bleach) before cleaning and then decontaminated with fresh disinfectant. 4.8.2 Spillage of Chemicals The essential steps are: i. Contain the spillage to prevent further spread ii. Prevent exposure of: o Other persons in the vicinity o Staff dealing with the spill iii. Absorb and dispose as quickly as possible iv. Decontaminate the area and return it to normal use. Similar principles apply to any other chemical spillage. For chemicals like glutaraldehyde which readily evaporate to produce very irritant fumes, a respirator designed for use with organic vapours should be worn. The liquid should be mopped up as quickly as possible with absorbent, disposable materials, which must then be double bagged and removed to the open air waste storage compounds as soon as possible. The area of the spill should be well ventilated, and will require sufficient time for the vapour to disperse before being reoccupied. 30 Mercury is another chemical whose handling should be mentioned. The main risk is that of skin absorption on contact with mercury, and by inhalation of mercury vapour which may slowly vaporise into the air from exposed surfaces of mercury. The risk is increased in hot, confined areas. Mercury readily combines with other metals to form \u2018amalgams; which in turn emit mercury vapour, and from which mercury may be absorbed by skin contact. Prevent contact with rings, by removal of jewellery, or wearing of disposable gloves, and with any metal equipment, as they may be difficult or impossible to decontaminate. The aim of the spillage procedure is to collect any significant quantity of free mercury (that could possibly be recycled) and to chemically combine any small remaining residues as quickly as possible"}

A checklist of what such a waste management plan or procedures should contain is found in Appendix 3. 4.10 Contingency Plan Each facility shall develop a contingency plan to provide guidance to waste management and other staff as well as visitors to facilities on measures to be implemented in the event of unexpected incidents. This plan is to include among others measures to manage spillages, fire, flooding and other hazards peculiar to the locality. 4.11 Health and Safety The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development through the District Assemblies jointly with the Ministry of Health and its implementing agencies as well as other corporate and individual employers within the health sector are responsible for providing the necessary resources for correct and effective health care waste management. Managers in the above MDAs and other organizations are expected to provide safe systems of work for staff generating, handling, storing, transporting treating and carrying out final disposal of waste. They are to institute a system of regular medical screening and immunizations for all staff involved in waste management. They are to provide appropriate information and training for all relevant staff. 31 They are to conduct regular monitoring and periodic reviews of the system, so that deficiencies are corrected within a reasonable timescale and the system continuously improved in the light of experience gained. Individual employees of the health sector are expected to exercise reasonable care to protect themselves and others who may be affected by their"}

In order to avoid any injuries or infection of people, health care waste handlers must i. Co-operate in matters of health and safety ii. Correctly use personal protective equipment and any other work equipment designated for the task. iii. Correctly apply the information and training received at induction and subsequently in handling issues such as: \uf0a7 Taking all necessary measures to ensure that re-usable containers are effectively disinfected before re-use. \uf0a7 Providing adequate service storage areas for health care waste. \uf0a7 Making provision for minimal manual handling of health care risk waste by ensuring that tolls and equipment to facilitate handling are in place. iv. Report any perceived hazards in their working environment or deficiencies in the safe system of work to their manager. In the event of an injury arising out of waste handling, it must immediately be reported to the relevant manager or supervisor and action taken based on the infection prevention, OHS and HIV / AIDS policies of the sector. 4.12 Record Keeping and Documentation Each health institution is required to maintain records of its waste management. In addition to stores and logistics management records at the institutional level issues regarding the type of waste, where it is generated, when separated, by whom and every other subsequent action until final disposal or handing over to a waste disposal company, when such is the case, shall be documented. The following are important specific information which should be documented by each institution: i. Information on Waste types and Handling Processes \uf0a7 Date \uf0a7 The type and volume/ weight of waste generated; \uf0a7 The type, origin and weight of waste received from other health care facilities (in cases where facilities are shared); \uf0a7 The means of transportation, type and volume transported; \uf0a7 The particulars of the commissioned"}

Records of environmental performance for incinerators should also be sent to the above authorities twice yearly. iii. The DHMTs and RHMTs shall ensure record compilation and analysis by the health facilities under their jurisdiction. 33 5 . TRAINING, CAPACITY BUILDING AND RESEARCH It is essential that training in the safe and correct management of health care waste is provided to all staff including health managers. This can be facilitated by the adoption of the following strategies: i) Pre- Service and Post Basic training of health workers should include health care waste management. There is the need therefore to review health training institutions\u2019 curricula to incorporate waste management. ii) Health care waste management should also be incorporated into in-service training curricula. This training should be tailored to the needs of health care providers. iii) Health managers shall ensure that all their staff undergo in-service training in health care waste management. iv) Training Curricula, Guidelines, and Training Manuals on health care waste management shall be developed to facilitate Pre-Service, In-Service and Post Basic training. v) Standard Operating Procedures (based on the national guidelines) shall be developed and communicated to all persons involved in the handling, transporting and disposal of health care wastes as well as their supervisors. vi) These standards should form the basis for the in-service training to be provided for managers and staff involved in the day to day disposal of health care waste. Their training should also cover contingency management of incidents involving health care management. vii) The responsible agencies within the health sector shall co-ordinate the drawing up of"}

INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEC ) AND ADVOCACY 6.1 Information, Education and Communication The importance of education of a people can not be over emphasized. The more conscious the society is of health care waste risks and how to minimise them, the more effective health care waste management will be. If our citizens understand the classification of waste, the need for waste minimization and separation using the recommended colour codes from their studies in school and adult education programmes, they will handle properly the waste they generate as patients and visitors to our hospitals, thereby facilitating health care waste management in the health facilities. This is even more critical considering the prevailing situation in which, in the face of the inadequacy of health personnel, relatives of patients have to play more roles in caring for their relatives on admission. The IEC plan will involve the use of mass media to educate the public on the importance of health care waste management, the coding system and what type of waste is to be placed in a particular type of vessel and the other essential elements of such education. Relevant aspects of the education should also be incorporated into the curricula of basic schools and adult education programmes. The public health as well as clinical care units should incorporate information on health care"}

Finally, at the institutional level, signs and posters should be strategically posted to educate and guide the public. 6.2 Advocacy Advocacy should be undertaken vigorously to solicit support for the policy from all stakeholders. Measures to achieve this include the following: i. The findings of the evaluation of health care management practices should be disseminated to all the stakeholder ministries, departments and agencies involved at the highest possible level. ii. The attention of the development partners and all civil society organizations should be drawn to the existing situation in order to obtain the widest possible support including financial commitment for the implementation of this and the development of a legal framework. iii. Feature articles in the print media drawing key messages from the findings of the policy should be published. This is necessary for whipping up the multi-sector collaboration and financial support that is required for the success of the programme. 35 iv. Other means of disseminating information will also be explored, for example use of mobile cinema vans in collaboration with Information Service Department; production of documentaries and docu-dramas which could be aired on TV stations; and posting of related information on websites of Ministry of Health/ Ghana Health Service/ The Ministry of Information and National Orientation (MNO) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and those of other MDAs and Stakeholders. v. There should also be media encounters, all in an effort to move health care waste management to the top of our priorities. We ought to be saying that if we can not handle the waste that we generate in the process of curing our people and this can become a serious source of health problem, then our people are better off without a health system. Our health institutions should be safe places"}

To secure the commitment of private health institutions, the MOH should involve them through their respective trade associations, in programs meant to implement the policy. The implementation of the policy has financial implications for health institutions which may tend to be a disincentive in the face of scarce resources. The private health institutions in particular should be encouraged to participate in the training programs that the MOH will organise for the health institutions under cost sharing arrangements. vii. The assistance of development partners, NGOs and other civil society organizations should be sought in order to reduce the financial burden on the institutions at least at the beginning. In the long term, more durable solutions to the funding problem that are consistent with the existing cost recovery policy should be explored. viii. The advocacy program should also encourage health care training institutions to include health care waste management into their curricula. All effort should be made to inform and educate key stakeholders in order to achieve unity of purpose and action. These efforts should include institutions that are responsible for approving new health institutions, e.g. Private Hospitals and Maternity Homes Board, to ensure that they insist on the health care waste management readiness of new institutions in terms of facilities, human resources, plans and other aspects of capacity to deliver. The same rigorous standards should be maintained in the monitoring of existing institutions and sanctions should include the withdrawal of certificates until the relevant shortfalls are corrected. 36 7. IMPLEMENTATION Health care waste management involves more than one sector. Intersectoral collaboration is therefore necessary for the effectiveness of the implementation of the programmes since the key players come from different ministries with their individual command structure. 7.1 General Principles of Implementation One of the key"}
{"source_file": "Health-Care-Waste-Management-Policy-and-Guidelines.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Care-Waste-Management-Policy-and-Guidelines_41", "text": "principles that inform the implementation plan outlined in the ensuing sections include \u2018the polluter pays\u2019 principle which requires the generator of waste to be legally and financially responsible for its disposal. But at the same time, there should be laid down steps to dispose of refuse if the polluter is unable to pay for its disposal. The other principles are: The Basel Convention - concerned with trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste including health care waste. The Precautionary Principle which advocates the adoption of measures to protect health and safety when the magnitude of the particular risk is uncertain. The Proximity Principle which requires hazardous waste including health care waste to be disposed of at the closest possible location to its source in order to minimise the risks involved in its transport. The National Environmental Policy which seeks to guide development in accordance with quality requirements to prevent, reduce and, as far as possible, eliminate pollution and nuisances. The National Environmental Sanitation Policy, 1999 which also requires all health care institutions to establish institutional waste management systems for the primary management of wastes. It requires Health Care Facilities to pre-treat health care waste (e.g. by autoclaving) prior to storage. The policy further states that District Assemblies shall provide for collection of hazardous and health care waste. Transport of such waste shall be in closed no-compaction vehicles which should be cleaned and/or disinfected at the end of every collection day Dedicated Funding which should be made available at all levels of implementation of the policy. Whereas every institution is to budget for treatment of waste in their annual plans, government will take responsibility for sourcing funding for capital items with a huge financial outlay such as incinerators and autoclaves. This is particularly important at the start of implementation activities to ensure that"}

The membership of HCWMC shall comprise the head of the institution, the Environmental Health Officer and three other senior officers (preferably heads of relevant departments involved in generating or handling waste in the facility). 7.2.2 At the District Level At the district level, DHMT will have responsibility for co-ordination and supervision. 7.2.3 At the Regional Level At the regional and teaching hospital, clinical care units will have the overall responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the policy. 7.2.4 At the National Level At the national level, the MOH will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the policy among the various sub sectors across the country. Within the Ghana Health Service, the Institutional Care Directorate (ICD) will have ultimate responsibility for implementation. The Estate Management Unit (EMU) of the Health Administration and Support Services (HASS) will act on behalf of the ICD in assuming day to day responsibility for co-ordinating waste management activities, ensuring that treatment and other related facilities are in functioning order and in the monitoring and supervision of the estate units within health facilities. This role will be performed in close co-operation with the ICD. 7.3 Responsibility for Implementation The MOH has ultimate responsibility for the implementation of this policy which is meant to provide guidance for the health sector as a whole. Each sub sector namely, the Ghana Health Service, the Teaching Hospitals, Quasi-Government Hospitals, Mission Hospitals and the Private sector health institutions are expected"}

There are other ministries apart from the MOH, which play complementary roles in the management of health care waste. These include the district/municipal/metropolitan assemblies, the Ministry of the Environment and Science, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, and Veterinary Services Department. The policy is therefore meant to dovetail the plans and responsibilities of these MDAs. Thus whilst the MOH through the individual institutions is responsible for segregating, storing and treating HCW, the 38 district/municipal/metropolitan assemblies have to ensure that the waste is transported and disposed of in the appropriate manner. In practice therefore, the health institutions\u2019 responsibility translate into the proper segregation, treatment where possible and transport to the transit point. The district/municipal/metropolitan assemblies have to ensure that there are well trained and effective companies in the system to do the transportation and disposal and in some cases, treatment. They are the ones to screen, license and supervise the private waste management companies. 39 8. MONITORING AND REVIEW Monitoring and review are very critical functions for the effectiveness of any programme. No matter how well a programme is planned and implemented, there are chances that some details may be overlooked. Good supervision and monitoring, as processes are underway, are critical in addition to post audits, to assure the discovery of errors and their correction in good time. They also provide the opportunity to review the plans as well as training programmes in order to make them more effective. Periodic reviews are also important in accessing program impact. Thus the effectiveness of the programmes will be assessed from both the point of view of management processes and programme impacts. The guidelines for Monitoring and Review are presented in the Sections 8.1 to 8.3. 8.1 Monitoring and Control The objective of"}

Assemblies are expected to enforce compliance. Though the HCWM committees are to advise on the handling and disposal of waste, daily supervision is to be carried out by the waste control manager (line manager of labourers and auxiliary staff involved in waste management) who in turn is answerable to the head of the institution. The institutional heads therefore have overall responsibility for ensuring that procedures are in place, are being implemented and sanctions enforced where appropriate. They are expected to work closely with the HCWM committee which they (or their representative) chair and conduct regular spot checks. In addition to daily and weekly inspections of procedures, the following parameters are to be monitored: i. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) which constitute part of these guidelines for persons involved at each stage of handling waste should be monitored frequently by supervisors in the health facility, by the DHMTS and the RHMTS. The SOPs cover areas like waste minimization, segregation of waste, transportation, storage, treatment and final disposal. In addition, it should cover the disinfection of reusable health care risk waste containers based on standards for disinfection as required by this guideline. ii. Minimum environmental performance requirements for controlled combustion treatment facilities like incinerators should be carried out at the onset of use of the facility and at least once yearly based on guidelines to be provided by the EPA. Where it may be considered more effective to conduct these determinations centrally, arrangements should be made to organize testing from national level. 40 8.2 Audits 8.2.1 Periodic Management Audit Each regional directorate should arrange to carry out its own internal audit on waste management practices in their facilities at least"}

Additionally, audits offered by audit bodies external to the MOH will be encouraged , to facilitate objective evaluations which favour comparisons with international norms on waste management. 8.2.3. Audit Tool Audit tools designed for measuring compliance with clinical waste procedures should be used for audits. An example of such an audit tool is to be found at Appendix 2 8.3 Reviews There should be a review of the performance of the HCWM programme two years after the launch of the policy and at the end of the fifth year to assess the compliance and the programme\u2019s impacts. These reviews will use the findings of studies conducted on health care waste practices in the hospitals as baseline and will assess the progress of the programme against the key indicators established. The types of waste disposal methods in use, emissions from incinerators and whether the composition meets the standards set by the relevant authorities and other issues will be tracked. 41 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

The formation of the Ghana Psychic and Traditional Healers Association in 1961 and the establishment of the Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine in 1975 attest to this fact. Also in 1991 the government established a unit for the coordination of Traditional Medicine (which is now Traditional and Alternative Medicine Directorate) which was followed by the setting up of the Food and Drugs Board in 1992, which among others, is to certify the sale of Traditional Medicine products to the public. In 2000, the government enacted the TMPC Act, Act 575 for the establishment of Traditional Medicine Council which is tasked with the responsibility for the registration of all Traditional Medical Practitioners in the country. An Alternative Medicine Bill is yet to be passed in parliament. Although all these documents provide a legal policy framework for the development of Traditional Medicine, there is no single document that coordinates the general policy direction of government in the area of traditional medicine. This policy document has been designed to fill this gap. The object is to provide a general policy direction or framework within which government\u2019s short to long term plans on TM would be based. It cuts across sectoral boundaries and provides a national position for which all sectors have to buy into. Almost all the relevant traditional medicine institutions and organizations were involved in the process of developing the document. Representatives were drawn from the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, Food and Drugs Board, Ghana National Drugs Programme, Centre for Scientific Research Into Plant Medicine, Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research, Ghana Federation of Traditional Medicine Practitioners Associations (GHAFTRAM), Ghana"}

It is hoped that the document will be relevant to all government institutions working towards the development of Traditional Medicine. Signature 2 1. Practice of traditional medicine and regulatory legislation. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY It is the policy of government to continue to research and develop Traditional Medicine with the aim integrating the products and returns into the health care delivery system of the country. The potential of traditional medicine has been recognized by successive governments. The establishment of the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Directorate of the Ministry of Health is to coordinate the activities of policy initiation and implementation. For the Directorate to work effectively there is the need for a general policy direction for coordinating activities in the area of traditional medicine. This is what this document seeks to address. The objective is to provide a general policy direction or framework within which government short to long term plans on Traditional Medicine would be based. The policy cuts across sectoral boundaries and provides a national position for which all sectors have to use as a basis for developing plans for traditional medicine development. The policy focuses on the following areas: 2. Re-organization and management of traditional medicine associations. 3. Intellectual Property Rights Protection 4. Professionalization of TM/CAM through formal training 5. Research and Product Development 6. Public I.E & C on Rational use of Traditional Medicine. 7. Standardization, quality assurance and large scale production. 8. Documentation, information exchange and baseline data collection. 9. Biodiversity conservation and sustainable harvesting. 10. Global Networking and Collaboration 11. Technology transfer and commercialization of best products"}

Integration of TM/CAM into national health systems and commercialization. 3 POLICY GUIDELINES AND ACTIONS 1.0 Practice of Traditional Medicine and Regulatory Legislation 1.1 Situation: There is high patronage of the Traditional Medicine (TM) for many reasons including belief, trust, proximity and cost and mode of payment. Thus TM is a national asset. It provides employment to indigenous people and there is the need to improve the practice. The main problems affecting the practice of Traditional Medicine include the lack of information on practitioners including their qualification, registration, educational background, location, number and the products used in their practices. Other problems include inappropriate premises for practice, inadequate record keeping by practitioners, inadequate facilities for diagnosis and the use of un-standardized products. Furthermore, there are varied and unknown TM practices in the country. Some of these practices particularly TM, are confined to families and the practice is home-based. These practices are not organized for training purposes. There are, also too many hawkers and peddlers practicing in the system. Alternative Medicines in particular are mainly foreign and imported. In most cases there are no recognized locally accredited training institutions and/or professional bodies. 1.2 Policy: i) All TMPs shall be required to register an association and the TM Council with the view to enhancing the practice and eliminating quacks in the system. ii) To assist the genuine practitioners, the umbrella association of TM shall be encouraged to organize training and educational programmes on good manufacturing practices. iii) TMPs shall keep accurate records of all their practices iv) TM practitioners shall be encouraged to use modern facilities to diagnose and monitor management of patients. v) TM shall be provided in all public health institutions. The purpose is to offer patients/clients options of health service from which to choose. vi) Appropriate standards of"}
{"source_file": "TRADITIONAL-MEDICINE-POLICY.pdf", "chunk_id": "TRADITIONAL-MEDICINE-POLICY_3", "text": "practice shall be set as and when facilities improve to make it easier for enforcement of legislation. 1.3 Implication: To ensure that TMPs keep accurate record on their practice require the design of appropriate record keeping formats that can easily be filled by practitioner given their education background. Also, TAMD in collaboration with the Traditional Medicine Practice Council may need to develop acceptable standards of practice for Traditional 4 Medicine Practitioners. Guideline for providing TM service in public health institutions shall be developed and implemented. 2.0 Organization and Management of Traditional Medicine Associations. 2.1 Situation: The obstacles impending the setting up of a single accountable organization representing TM practitioners include the presence of many splinter groups each with divergent views, visions and expectations. Individual association appears not to be well represented at the grassroots level and there is often misunderstanding and lack of information sharing amongst stakeholders. Suspicion between members of different groups, personality projections, and power and ego clashes are not uncommon. 2.2 Policy The TAM Directorate shall be strengthened to mobilize and organize practitioners at all levels. This is to ensure that all the groups are well organized with the view to increasing the flow of information available to all TM practitioners. The management of the organization of practitioners shall be decentralized to the regional, district, sub-district and community levels. Traditional Medicine Practice Council will be required to regulate practices particularly in the private sector. 2.3 Implications Establish administrative structure at regional and district level to develop level specific plans to monitor and evaluate Traditional Medicine Practice in collaboration with the Associations. Also, personnel at these levels would have to provide management support for the organization of the associations. The structure for managing and regulating practitioners would have to be formalized through a national legislation that will lead"}

The Executives of GHAFTRAM at regional and district levels will need to be equipped with managerial skills and orientation to enable them function effectively in keeping the groups together. Regular meetings shall be held between TAMD, and the Traditional Medicine Practice Council to review organizational problems and resolve them. 3.0 Intellectual Property Rights Protection 3.1 Situation: Currently, there is an apparent lack of well-defined legislation covering patenting with respect to traditional medicine products and procedures. Among practitioners there is ignorance about the meaning, implication and workings of patent laws and rights as well 5 as the availability of trademark registers and protection. Generally, there is a lack of knowledge among TMPs on the need for intellectual property rights protection. Traditional Medicine Practitioners do not share information on their knowledge (practice and preparation) due to: (i) Lack of trust (ii) Fear of loosing their livelihood (iii) Oath of secrecy (iv) Maintenance of their status and reputation The above observations are reasons given by TMPs for their unwillingness to disclose vital information and knowledge of their practices and products. It is worth nothing that plants cannot be patented but knowledge of use of plants and formulation of the plant products can be patented. 3.2 Policies: (i) TM practitioners shall be educated on all aspects of patent, copyright and trademark laws (ii) IPR system in respect of indigenous knowledge of TM practitioners and other scientists shall be protected and harnessed. 3.3 Implication There is the need to develop a generic system for TMP knowledge as well as guidelines for IPR. Also, the Ministry may need to set up a system to facilitate the processes involved in gaining access to IPR for TMPs. Moreover, TMPs would have to be trained no how to keep records or document their"}

There are no established institutions for training TMPs and their trainers. There is no TM component in the syllabi for the training of orthodox medical practitioners and lack of motivation for orthodox practitioners who embark upon TMP training programs. 6 4.2 Policy: (i) Training shall be provided for TM to improve their knowledge and skills of practice. The cost of such training shall be borne by the government. (ii) Training curriculum shall be developed for TMP training at all levels. (iii) Allopathic health practitioners shall be encouraged to study and practice TM and vice versa. 4.3 Implication Already training needs assessment has been conducted. A training manual has also been prepared. The next step is to design training programme and schedule that would fit the convenience of the practitioners given that they have other economic interests. TAMD in collaboration with the Traditional Medicine Practice Council has to put in Place a system for following up trained practitioners to assess their performance after training so that in-service-training programmes can be instituted for them. 5.0 Research and Product Development 5.1 Situation: Research into TM is hampered by the lack of funds, personnel and facilities. Researches that are carried out is uncoordinated nationwide with little or no prioritization. There is very little interaction between scientists and practitioners and generally, there is a worrying lack of recognition of the need for the benefits of research and development towards improving practice. 5.2 Policy: (i) TM practitioners shall be trained in research methods to enable them carry out research and documentation of results of their practices. (ii) Guidelines shall be provided for efficacy and safety studies in relation to TM medicine products to"}

(iv) TM practitioners shall be required to document and report all adverse effects of plant medicine products and all reported cases shall be investigated. (v) Interaction between TM practitioners and Allopathic practitioners shall be encouraged through research. Seminars, workshops and symposia. 7 (vi) All national research institutions shall be equipped to undertake research into TM practices to advance the development of TM (vii) The TAMD shall seek entrepreneurial linkage for product development for commercial manufacture of TM product with proven effectiveness and in the areas of public concern. 5.3 Implications The implications are the need to develop a research agenda in relation to traditional medicine and specific diseases of public health concern. Also appropriate and harmonized research methods need to be developed for TMPs. The capacity to promptly investigate adverse reactions needs to be developed. This requires additional human resource with the requisite skills at the proposed collection centre. 6.0 I. E and C on Rational Use of Traditional Medicine 6.1 Situation: There is inadequate knowledge among a section of the general public of the capabilities and benefits of TM. Thus, a section of the public has some misgivings about plant medicine products. The health care system is bias towards allopathic medicine. These problems are not helped by the fact that very little documentation exists on the practice and products of TM. 6.2 Policy: (i) Public education shall be intensified on the values, benefits and dangers associated with both practices. (ii) The Directorate shall collaborate with Ministry of Education/Ghana Education Service to incorporate into the school university curricula studies on Traditional Medicine. (iii) The media shall be trained and supported to promote TM. 6.3 Implications An information, Education and communication strategy and programme should be drawn"}

Guidelines for advertising TM product should be developed taking into consideration national guidelines on advertising drugs. There should be training and orientation programmes for media houses and personnel on advertising of TM products. 8 7.0 Standardization, Quality Assurance and Large-scale Production 7.1 Situation: Traditional medicines are being dispensed to patients. Some products are being sold to the public without established evidence of safety and efficacy. Production of traditional/plant medicine product do not meet the standards of Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and they lack standardization. Some practitioners are not willing to comply with Food Drug Board\u2019s (FDB) requirements to disclose the identity of the plants they use for their product preparation. 7.2 Policy: (iii) TM practitioners shall be assisted to standardize their medicinal product to ensure uniformity in the batches that are offered for sale. (iv) Manufacturing premises shall be regularly inspected to ensure good manufacturing practices (GMP). (v) TM practitioners shall be required to disclose vital information on their products before registration of traditional medicinal products (vi) MOH shall promote the use of TM products by allopathic practitioners. 7.3 Implication The training of TM practitioners should include standardization of medicinal products and good manufacturing practices and a system for monitoring and evaluating the competency of TMPs should be put in place. 7.4 Situation: Evaluating Efficacy and Safety (a) Availability of Testing Facilities The centres that have some facilities for testing TM products are: \u25cf The centre for clinical pharmacology and therapeutics, University of Ghana Medicinal School \u25cf The Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Legon \u25cf The Faculty of Pharmacy, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology \u25cf The Biochemistry Department, University of Ghana Legon \u25cf The chemistry Department, University of Cape Coast \u25cf Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine. 9 However, these institutions are not fully"}

(b) Geographical access to testing facilities All of these institutions, apart from the Faculty of Pharmacy are situated in the southern sector of the country limiting access to practitioners in the North. Financial access to testing facilities The main problems in this area include: \u2022 The relatively high cost of testing \u2022 The poor financial status of practitioners generally and The lack of adequate human and equipment resources with respect to the testing centres. 7.5 Safety and Efficacy Situation: The Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine was established in 1975 to research into plant medicine, standardize their preparation and ensure safety of herbal medicine products. Policy: (i) TM practitioners shall be encouraged to disclose information on their products that would be vital for complete evaluation (safety, efficacy and quality) of their products. This activity is performed for and on behalf of the Food and Drugs Board which gives authorization for manufacture and sale of herbal medicines. Over 1000 herbal medicines have been screened for safety since 2001. Many herbal remedies in circulation and in use at the clinic level have however not been tested. Some practitioners do not feel the need for such tests, whilst other site lack of finances to pay the fee for such tests to be done"}

These procedures and standards shall be harmonized for use by all research units and universities. (iii) For the short term, institutional strengths in conducting specific and specialized tests shall be identified and used as a guide to direct requests to the appropriate institution. (iv) The Ministry of Health or the Traditional Medicine Practice Council shall establish regional/district collection centres where materials for testing are submitted for onward transmission to appropriate testing centres. (v) A testing centre shall be established in the North. (vi) Financial support would be provided to improve the safety, quality and efficacy of TM products in use in Ghana. Special consideration shall be given in products for diseases of public health concern. Existing and future testing centres shall be supported in terms of equipment, human and infrastructural development. 7.6 Implication: Ministry of Health is to put in place mechanisms to assure TMPs of their Intellectual Property Rights. There is the need for legal review on Intellectual Property Right in respect of TM. Establishment of collection and testing centres require the acquisition of office accommodation in the respective regions and staff employed. A scheme of service for staff may have to be developed as well and training provided to equip them to the tasks. In the case of testing centres a range of equipment needs to be determined and acquired. 8.0 Documentation, information exchange and collection of baseline data 8.1 Situation: A number of raw materials, plants, animals and minerals are used by TMPs in preparing their medicines. However, not all of them have been documented. 11 8.2 Policy: (i) TM practitioners shall be encouraged and supported to document all the biological/medicinal products they use in their practices. (ii) Government shall"}

(iii) To be able to set mediators and targets, there is need to collect adequate baseline data 8.3 Implications: A national library for TM shall be set-up to keep all relevant research works and information which could serve as learning centers for TM students and trainees. 9.0. Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Harvesting. 9.1 Situation: Generally, traditional medicinal products especially plants are collected from the wild. However, this is not done efficiently in that plant parts are removed without replacement. This is complicated by large-scale collection for export that threatens extinct of some species. Added to these is the fact that there is lack of expertise in cultivation and collection of herbal products. Other problems threatening maintenance of sustainable biodiversity include: \u2022 A lack of environmental awareness within the general population leading to destruction of the environment as a result of farming practices, mining, industrialization and urbanization; \u2022 Lack of data on national biodiversity \u2022 Poor planning and / or enforcement of planning regulations. \u2022 Misidentification 9.2 Policy: (i) The commercial collectors shall be educated and trained on techniques of sustainable harvesting. (ii) Large-scale collectors shall be registered and their activities monitored. 12 (iii) All large-scale Commercial collectors of medicinal plants shall be required to provide their programme on replanting to enhance monitoring and sustainability. (iv) Commercial collectors of medicinal plant parts shall be made to use some of their resources to replenish the plants they destroy. (v) Current biodiversity in the country shall be assessed and usage documented. (vi) TM practitioners shall be encouraged and financially supported to cultivate their sources of materials. 9.3 Implication: Biodiversity Planning needs to be undertaken to ensure effective utilization and sustainability. Also guidelines for collection of biodiversity will need"}

It is established that Traditional medicine has played a successful intervention in the global health care delivery system and best results are scattered all over the world. There is therefore the need for networking, collaboration and exchange of information, locally and internationally to be done among stakeholders. 10.2 Policy: A directory of international collaborator should be prepared and reviewed continually. Provision should be made for key staff to attend relevant local and international courses, workshops and conferences. 10.3 Implications: Funds should be sourced to finance organization and attendance of convergence meetings and workshops for the purpose of developing policies, tools and sharing of information. 13 11.0 Technology Transfer and Commercialization 11.1 Situation: The main strength in this area is the availability of ready markets for the products of TM. However several problems militate against commercialization, of TM products and these include the absence of supporting industries for commercialization, poor funding, poor packaging and labelling and absence of standardization. There is also an absence of a resource base e.g. materials, equipment, personnel. 11.2 Policy: (i) Large scale commercialization of TAM products shall be encouraged and financially supported. (ii) Extensive local use of TAM medicinal products shall be encouraged through education and provision of such products at public health institutions. 11.3 Implication: Implication is to work with other agencies, e.g. Ministry of Lands and Forestry and Export Promotion Council to ensure proper planning and urination of the available Biodiversity in the country.

Thus, there is a very loose co-operation between OMPs and TMPs. While in some cases TMPs are rendering some useful services, in many cases their practices are not up to expectations. TMPs will education and training to upgrade their knowledge and skills. There is the feeling among TMPs that they are not being accorded the needed recognition by OMPs. Thus, there is resistance to integration with the allopathic health care system. There is also lack of coordination between national institutions like the Food and Drugs Board. Ghana Standards Board, and Universities etc. 14 12.2 Policy: (i) The Traditional Medicine Practice Council (TMPC) shall encourage training and education of TMPs to upgrade their knowledge and skills with the view to strengthening the co-operation between TMPs and OMPs (ii) For the short term, the TMPC shall organize training programmes along the lines organized for TBAs to improve upon the practices of TMPs. (iii) Government shall support higher institutions which would like to mount training programmes in TM. (iv) The Ministry shall encourage collaboration between TM and OM practitioners through education on all sides to arrive at cooperation. (v) Integration shall take place at the product level by putting them at the disposal of both practitioners. 13. 2 Implications: This situation shall be reversed by organizing regular inter-sectoral meetings of stakeholders to discuss specific areas of common interest.

The only treatment for hypoxemia is medical oxygen therapy. Medical oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen therapy, is the use of inhaled oxygen as an essential medicine in medical treatment. The purpose of supplying additional oxygen is to eliminate hypoxemia that may lead to tissue hypoxia and death. Oxygen supplementary treatment works by increasing oxygen content in the blood in patients with low levels of blood, in an attempt to oxygenate the vital organs in the body and avoid tissue hypoxia and death. In Ghana, hypoxemia-related morbidity and mortality is a common event, which was exacerbated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, institutional deaths associated with respiratory diseases contributed to 15.5% of deaths across all ages. For children under five years, 16.5% died due to respiratory diseases. It is reported that there are about 5,000 pneumonia-related deaths annually in new-born and children younger than 5 years in Ghana (the third highest cause of death in this age group). Studies have shown that improved supply and utilization of oxygen in the healthcare setting has the potential to reduce mortality from childhood pneumonia by 35%. In summary, the ability to quickly detect and treat hypoxemia is critical to patient care. COVID-19 pandemic brought to light the inadequacies in the production, supply, distribution, and use of medical oxygen globally, regionally, and in Ghana specifically. It has accelerated global demand for medical oxygen by 3-7 folds and made the delivery of oxygen supplies more urgent than"}

It is against this background that, the Ministry of Health, its Agencies, Development Partners and Key Stakeholders (including the Private Sector) have come together to develop the National Medical Oxygen Policy, to establish the framework and lay the foundation for a national strategy for scaling-up production, availability, access, and use of medical oxygen across the country. As the Minister responsible for Health, I have a strong belief that if this policy is implemented effectively by all sector players, Ghana will reduce drastically hypoxemia related deaths especially pneumonia to the barest level.

The only treatment for hypoxemia is medical oxygen therapy. Medical oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen therapy, is the use of inhaled oxygen as an essential medicine in medical treatment. The purpose of supplying additional oxygen is to eliminate hypoxemia that may lead to tissue hypoxia and death. Oxygen supplementary treatment works by increasing oxygen content in the blood in patients with low levels of blood, in an attempt to oxygenate the vital organs in the body and avoid tissue hypoxia. Medical oxygen is crucial and essential for the treatment of patients with diseases that affect lung function, shortness of breath, or difficulty in breathing which hampers the supply of oxygen to various parts of the body. This includes pneumonia, birth asphyxia, sepsis, malaria, asthma, heart disease and lung diseases, amongst others. Pneumonia is a major cause of hypoxaemia leading to death among all age groups. Pneumonia resulted in 1.4"}

In 2015, pneumonia was responsible for the deaths of 473,000 African children under the age of five years old.[5] In Sub- Saharan Africa, there are an estimated four million cases and 200,000 deaths in adult populations per year.[3] . It is estimated that 20\u201340% of these deaths could be prevented with the availability of oxygen therapy[4]. Oxygen is used across all levels of the healthcare system; it is essential in safe surgery, anaesthesia, obstetric, and emergency care, within several units of the health system including Neonatal (New-Born) Intensive Care Units (NICU), Paediatric Units, General wards, Emergency transport (Ambulance), Delivery Units, and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The COVID-19 pandemic brought to bear, the inadequacies in the production, supply, distribution and use of medical oxygen globally, regionally, and in Ghana specifically. It has accelerated global demand for medical oxygen by 3-7 folds and made the delivery of oxygen supplies more urgent than ever.5 Ghana still faces a high burden of deaths due to lack of access to oxygen. Despite numerous World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, emphasising the importance of oxygen across the continuum of care, availability and supply of medical oxygen to patients has been inadequate, especially to those who need it most. 1.0 CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION National Medical Oxygen Policy 2 Specific barriers to availability and supply of oxygen resources in Ghana include limited production capacity, inefficient logistics management (especially transportation), limited oxygen cylinders and high production cost. Additionally, an erratic payment system, inadequate human resources capacity (for use, maintenance, and management), inadequate technical training, poor quality and unreliable power supply, high electricity tariffs, erratic supply chain systems and logistics,"}

Additionally, the availability of medical oxygen in public and private health facilities as well as pre-hospital care services, highly depends on a facility\u2019s geographic location and their proximity to oxygen generation sources. In urban centres and high -population regions, medical oxygen is more readily available whereas in remote areas, supply chain and logistical challenges along with infrastructural limitations (e.g., electricity availability and road network) limit access to medical oxygen. There is therefore the need to address the availability of oxygen delivery and monitoring devices as vital health commodities and as part of the measures to scale up medical oxygen access and use in the country. To mitigate these aforementioned challenges, there have been multiple initiatives by the Ministry of Health, its Agencies and Partners, the Private Sector, and other health care providers (including the private and Quasi-Governmental providers) to improve medical oxygen availability in the country. These initiatives have included the installation of onsite Oxygen Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants, procurement, and distribution of medical oxygen and therapy commodities to health facilities and ambulances. 1 https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death, ^ Jump up to:a b \u201cThe top 10 causes of death\u201d. www.who.int.

Oxygen concentrators and cylinders remain the most common modalities of oxygen provision to patients in Ghana. Despite these efforts, most health facilities and ambulances in the country have limited availability of a continuous source of medical oxygen. It is therefore appropriate that the Ministry of Health ensures that medical oxygen production and access is adequately funded, always available and captured in health plans and budgets. This National Medical Oxygen Policy, therefore, seeks to establish the framework and lay the foundation for a national strategy for scaling-up production, availability, access and use of medical oxygen across the country. It also lays the foundation for operational policies and technical guidelines for all stakeholders within the health sector for both public and private alike. 1.2 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS In Ghana, hypoxemia-related morbidity and mortality is a common event, which was exacerbated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, institutional deaths associated with respiratory diseases contributed to 15.5% of deaths across all ages. For children under five years, 16.5% died due to respiratory diseases. It is reported that there are about 5,000 pneumonia-related deaths annually in new- born and children under 5 in Ghana (the third highest cause of death in this age group)6. Studies have shown that improved supply and utilization of oxygen in the healthcare setting has the potential to reduce mortality from childhood pneumonia by 35%7. In summary, the ability to quickly detect and treat hypoxemia is critical to patient care. After the declaration of the novel COVID-19 as a pandemic by the President of the Republic of Ghana in March 2020, Ghana experienced three waves of COVID-19 infections within 18 months: from May to August 2020, and again from January to March 2021, then July to September 2021. The second and third waves were"}

National Medical Oxygen Policy 4 The second and third waves resulted in an increase in the case fatality rate from 0.6% in December 2020 to 2.4% in September 2021 (Figure 1). During these periods, the demand for medical oxygen was very high with reported shortages in all healthcare facilities. Patient admissions into healthcare facilities for COVID-19 treatment were largely influenced by availability of medical oxygen. In line with the country\u2019s Strategic Response Plan for COVID-19, which aimed to: contain the virus; slow down and manage community spread; provide medical and psychosocial care for COVID-19 cases; and minimize the impact on social and economic life, it was imperative for Ghana to adequately prepare for a surge. The country\u2019s experience during the second and third waves illustrated the growing demand for therapeutics, including medical oxygen. Limited access to and use of effective diagnostic tools and medical oxygen for diagnosis, treatment and management of hypoxemia, as well as the absence of supportive clinical governance and equipment maintenance systems, were prevalent in Ghana. Diagnostic tools such as pulse oximeters, which support the diagnosis of hypoxemia, and monitors the patients\u2019 response to oxygen therapy, were also not readily available.

This mandate is performed through the public agencies under the MoH, other public agencies under other ministries and private not-for-profit and private- for-profit organisations. Service delivery public agencies and organisations under the MoH include Ghana Health Service, National Blood Service, National Ambulance Service, Saint John\u2019s Ambulance Brigade, Ghana Red Cross Society, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Tamale Teaching Hospital and Ho Teaching Hospital. Other public agencies which are not under the MoH include the Quasi-Governmental Health Institutions. Not-for- profit private sector service providers include the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) and the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission Health Services, and the Society of Private Self-Financing Facilities which are for profit.

The apex facility along the continuum of care is at the tertiary level, represented by Teaching Hospitals, while the regional hospitals are the secondary level facilities with the district hospital serving as the primary level of care. The primary level of the healthcare system includes: 1) Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) serving as the close-to-client and first point- of-call facility: 2) the sub-districts with the Health Centres as the point-of-care at the sub-district level; and finally 3) the district hospital or Polyclinic as the apex point of care at the district level.

Ten (10) of the remaining fifteen (15) producers in operation were using Cryogenic technology. Among the fifteen (15) active oxygen producers in operation, three (3) were steel production companies whose core mandate was to produce oxygen for refining steel. However, due to the spike in the oxygen demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the steel production companies dedicated some of their oxygen plants to supply health institutions with medical oxygen.

Several health facilities are confronted with challenges in oxygen access and sufficiency. These challenges include: \u2022 High cost of oxygen producing plants; \u2022 Lack of or inadequate oxygen cylinders; \u2022 High oxygen cylinder transportation cost; \u2022 Lack of funds to guarantee timely payment; \u2022 Non-existent tariff regime for cost recovery for oxygen administered to patients; \u2022 Inconsistent supply/delivery of oxygen by vendors; \u2022 High debt burden from purchases of oxygen; \u2022 Insufficient capacity to maintain oxygen systems; \u2022 Lack of or insufficient oxygen piping network systems coupled with leakages; and \u2022 Increase in demand due to COVID-19 pandemic. All these challenges contribute to frequent stock out and shortages in oxygen supply in many health facilities across the country. 1.2.4 PROCUREMENT LANDSCAPE The responsibility for procuring medical oxygen and related equipment lies primarily with the individual health facilities. Decentralised procurement to this effect makes it difficult to coordinate the use, negotiate and standardize the prices for medical oxygen and efficiently provide training to end-users and maintenance professionals. For example, hospitals can procure medical oxygen and related equipment independently using their budgets. There is a need for a national guideline with technical specifications to guide procurement practices across the country. National Medical Oxygen Policy 17 There are three types of oxygen production companies in Ghana: 1. Commercial oxygen producers; 2. Steel manufacturers and; 3. Other industrial manufacturers (e.g. mining companies). As of August 2021, steel companies sold their oxygen around GH\u20b55.00 (equivalent to US$0.85) per cubic meter of oxygen whilst the commercial oxygen producers sold their oxygen between GH\u20b510.00(equivalent to US$1.71) to GH\u20b520.00(equivalent to US$3.42) per cubic meter, depending on the technology they use in producing the oxygen. The wide variation"}
{"source_file": "National-Medical-Oxygen-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "National-Medical-Oxygen-Policy_18", "text": "in the prices between the steel companies and the commercial oxygen producers is due to the special subsidized electricity tariffs and tax incentives offered to the steel companies, to which the commercial oxygen producers are not entitled. For example, whilst the steel companies pay around 50p/kWh of electricity, the commercial medical oxygen producers pay close to GH\u20b520.00/kWh of electricity. Thus, the pricing of medical oxygen in Ghana is highly influenced by the electricity tariff. In addition to the local production of oxygen, some companies import oxygen for use in Ghana.

Government, as part of the capital investment program, finances the initial set up of the medical oxygen as part of the medical gas systems in some health facilities. It provides assistance for the installation of onsite medical oxygen production plants, installation of the central piping network for distribution of oxygen, provision of oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and related equipment or accessories. On the other hand, facilities are responsible for the maintenance and refilling of the oxygen cylinders using their facility\u2019s Internal Generated Fund (IGF). 9 Ministry of Health, Ghana National Drugs Programme, Essential Medicines List Seventh Edition, 2017 National Medical Oxygen Policy 19 Higher-level facilities including the secondary and tertiary levels are able to finance oxygen supply and undertake oxygen plant and oxygen concentrator maintenance (both planned and corrective) to some extent. On the other hand, majority of the Primary Health Care facilities (from District Hospitals down to CHPS Compounds) which depend heavily on the NHIS reimbursement for their IGF are challenged with funding for oxygen supply. Since the NHIS does not currently reimburse oxygen as a medicine separately, but rather as bundle charges, the facilities are not able to realistically recover the cost of medical oxygen consumed by the patients. This results in insufficient funding for medical oxygen. Also delays in the NHIS reimbursement causes health facilities to be consistently in payment arrears. For example, facilities that rely on oxygen supply in cylinders often face oxygen stock-outs as some suppliers will not refill oxygen cylinders if an account has an outstanding balance. With undue delays, some facilities are denied supply of medical oxygen, which results in stock-outs of oxygen. Similarly, the National Ambulance"}

Oxygen for ambulance services delivery is financed by the GoG annual budget allocation, however, the amounts budgeted for are not released on time and are inadequate to support the procurement of oxygen and they are always in arrears. 1.2.6 REGULATORY LANDSCAPE Essential medicines, including medical oxygen, are regulated under sections 111 to 132 of Part Seven of the Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851). Medical oxygen is listed on the Essential Medicines List, 2017 . However, enforcement of regulation on medical oxygen systems production and standards are limited. Although medical oxygen is packaged in pressure vessels (cylinders) and could be regulated under the Factories, Offices, and Shops (Boiler and Pressure Vessels) Safety Act, 1970 (Act 663), the Act does not take into consideration medical oxygen cylinders. To regulate medical oxygen cylinders or pressure vessels for medical oxygen, the Act needs to be reviewed. National Medical Oxygen Policy 20 1.2.7 AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION LANDSCAPE Reference to the section on oxygen production landscape, oxygen is available on the commercial market but at a higher cost. Health facilities purchase the oxygen in cylinders and transport them to their facility. The high cost of oxygen result in inadequate supply of oxygen in these health facilities. Unfortunately, medical oxygen is an important resource for the survival of patients especially COVID-19 patients and patients in respiratory distress. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, oxygen stock-out in health facilities existed but was not a major issue. With the COVID-19 pandemic, oxygen demand has increased by 3-7 folds. This has worsened the already existing situation and health facilities are challenged with frequent oxygen shortages. Table 5 below, shows the severity of COVID-19 conditions and amount of oxygen demand for effective treatment. The table illustrates that for"}

These hospitals depend solely on oxygen in cylinders with the exception of Ho Teaching Hospital and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital which had Liquid Oxygen and PSA Plant respectively. Though there is no scientific data to fully quantify the utilization of medical oxygen in health facilities in Ghana, the recent UNICEF-supported Oxygen Quantification Assessment, which covered 59 health facilities in eight regions, has provided some evidence on the medical oxygen demand in various types of health facilities.

Supply of medical oxygen in CHPS Compounds, Clinics and Health Centres do not require piping to deliver medical oxygen within the health facility to patients. On the other hand, hospital and polyclinics require a central oxygen piping network to efficiently deliver medical oxygen to patients. Unfortunately, most hospitals do not have the appropriate medical oxygen piping systems. This compels such hospitals to resort to the delivery of medical oxygen in cylinders directly to the patient, a practice which is characterised with serious safety consequences. The UNICEF/GHS Quantification Assessment further confirmed the extent of dependence on oxygen cylinder utilisation at patients\u2019 bedside. Provision of piping system in the hospitals is essential in eliminating the unsafe practice of using high-pressure oxygen cylinders at the patients\u2019 bedside. Fortunately, newly constructed hospitals are equipped with medical oxygen piping systems, a practice that must be sustained and replicated in all hospitals.

It must, therefore, be noted that this Policy is not intended for the production, distribution and use of industrial oxygen, including the aviation use of oxygen, but only limited to medical oxygen for clinical use. 1.4 POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS This Policy was developed under the stewardship of the Honourable Minister for Health, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu (MP), and an Inter-Agency Steering Committee under the leadership of the Chief Director of the Ministry of Health, Mr. Kwabena Boadu Oku-Afari. A Technical Working Group was constituted by the Minister to draft the policy document. The draft policy document was then subjected to thorough stakeholder consultation, review and validation. The validated draft policy was submitted to Cabinet and has subsequently been approved and adopted for implementation. The drafting of the document was started in August 2020 and was finally approved by Cabinet in October 2022 National Medical Oxygen Policy 25 2.1 GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT The policy recognizes several global, regional, and sub-regional compacts and policy frameworks. The following, among others, are mentioned here: the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the theme, \u201cTransforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the Astana Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC), the African Union (AU) Vision 2063: \u201cThe Africa We Want\u201d, the African Health Strategy (2016-2030), and Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030. Medical oxygen is on the WHO Essential Medicine List 21st Edition 2019.

This Health Sector ICT Policy and Strategy charts a roadmap for the exploitation, development and deployment of ICT to accelerate the service delivery process. It is guided by the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy. I am pleased to note that the development of this policy was based on an extensive sector-wide consultation with stakeholders from the public and private sectors. I therefore call on all players in the health sector to contribute to and support the implementation of the provisions of this policy. This will enable the sector to achieve its vision to improve overall health status and reduce inequalities in health outcomes of people living in Ghana. Hon. Major Courage Quashigah (rtd.)

There are marked achievements in several areas including immunization rates, under-five mortality and the control or eradication of some communicable diseases. However, several problems, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, maternal and infant mortality, the crippling shortage of health professionals, availability of affordable health care and interventions, have worsened. This has resulted in the widening of the health gap between the urban and the rural populace, between the rich"}

Consequently, the health sector\u2019s overall goal for this decade is the reduction in health inequalities. Information and communication technology (ICT) can play a major role in the achievement of the health sector\u2019s goal. ICT is increasingly applied to the global health sector because it can significantly enhance and improve all facets of health services delivery. However, the application of ICTs in the Ghanaian health sector will be constrained by several challenges if left unaddressed. Some of these challenges are a weak telecommunications infrastructure, an inadequate capacity in ICT human resources, and planning and financial constraints. Information, communication and technology can also make a significant contribution to the realization of the five strategic objectives of the health sector\u2019s 2002-2006 5-Year Programme of Work. Specifically, ICTs can \uf0b7 Increase access to health services by expanding the scope of activities of health professionals and specialists in a way that will minimize the effect of their low numbers in the sector; by supporting the establishment of a rapid response system to enhance performance in both clinical and public health care; and by empowering patients so that they will seek quality care and make the right demands on the health care system. \uf0b7 Improve quality of health care delivery by facilitating skill transfer to the periphery; by enhancing service supervision and regulation; by improving access to primary healthcare services; and by supporting the emergency, ambulatory, disaster management systems and blood banking and organ donation systems. \uf0b7 Improve efficiency of heath delivery by improving both management and technical efficiency of the sector through reliable information dissemination systems; and by supporting the decision making process through the prompt availability of information for all decision-makers. \uf0b7 Foster partnerships in improving health through dissemination of health information and data; by providing support to overall planning and"}

The Government of Ghana\u2019s information and communication technology policy document, ICT for Accelerated Development, has stated that ICTs should be utilized to promote national health. The major goal of this document is the formulation of a strategic roadmap to achieve the vision and goal of the national health ICT policy. The objectives, with associated strategies, for this roadmap are: \uf0b7 Improve the information and communication technology infrastructure in the health sector by networking all health institutions and by providing adequate ICT tools for service delivery and management \uf0b7 Improve access to and management of health information by deploying a health information dissemination network and an health information management systems network \uf0b7 Improve access to quality health services by deploying telemedicine applications in the health sector and by utilizing ICTs to enhance the referral, emergency and disaster management systems \uf0b7 Improve ICT knowledge, capability and utilization among health workers by providing training in ICT skills to all prospective and current health workers; by maintaining a critical group of ICTs specialists in the health sector; and by deploying ICTs to support and enhance job functions of health workers. This strategic document also proposes several programs and initiatives that are essential for the attainment of the health sector\u2019s ICT objectives and strategies. In addition, technical norms, procedures, standards and legislation for the use and management of information are discussed. Finally, successful deployment of ICT in the health sector depends largely on strong corporate commitment and political will, visionary leadership, adequate funding, support from all sections of the health sector and an active participation of the general public. 1 1. BACKGROUND 1.1 Introduction"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy_4", "text": "Impressive advances in science, especially in health care delivery, have significantly improved the health status of the global citizen in the past century. However, the forecast of good health for Ghanaians remains bleak in this new century. Ghana continues to suffer from malaria and HIV/AIDS epidemics, an increase in infant and maternal mortality, a rise in the incidences of stroke and cardiovascular diseases, and resurgence in previously eradicated communicable diseases. This situation will continue to diminish life expectancy beyond even pre-Independence levels unless and until innovative interventions are put in place within the entire health sector. The global health sector makes effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) to facilitate and improve almost all facets of health services delivery. So far, the Ghanaian health sector seems to have responded to the ICT revolution by allowing some acquisition and use of computers and in service delivery, management and administration. Yet, even this modest response has been less structured than desired, as exploitation of ICT has been driven by individual, private interest and innovation rather than by a recognized corporate need. This has resulted in diverse degrees of utilization of ICT in the sector and a digital divide between the Ministry of Health\u2019s headquarters, the regions and the districts. Hence, the complete benefits of ICT have so far not been realized in the health sector. An ICT policy and strategy has been identified as a necessary first step in the process of transforming the current health system into an ICT-enabled health delivery system that will improve the health outcomes of the citizens of Ghana. 1.2 Policy Context The development of an information and communications technology (ICT) policy and strategy for the health sector is framed by certain key issues and realities. The Ministry of Health\u2019s Five Year Programme of Work (5YrPOW)"}

Meanwhile, the Government of Ghana\u2019s ICT policy document, known as ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD), has identified health as one of the priority sectors in which the broad adoption of ICT can enable the government to achieve its developmental goals. Indeed, ICT4AD directs all Ministries, 2 Departments and Agencies to translate the national policy into sector specific ICT policies and strategies. The Ministry of Communications has therefore established an ICT Policy and Plan Development Committee to provide technical and financial support for the development of these sector specific ICT policies and strategies. Thirdly, several in-depth reviews and studies, including the Information, Monitoring and Evaluation System Review1 and the Ghana eHealth Solutions2 study, have decried the low utilization of ICT in the health sector and underscored the need for an ICT policy and strategy. Other significant events in the health sector have also contributed to highlight the urgent need for this document. The Government of Ghana has recently reengineered the Ministry of Health to emphasize its policy formulation and regulatory roles. Technical implementation of policy, previously the Ministry\u2019s primary function, has been shifted to other agencies within the health sector. The Government of Ghana is also instituting financial reforms based on decentralization to the district level, as a necessary component of this reengineering. Recently, a major government policy abolished the \u201cCash and Carry\u201d system for the payment of health care services and introduced a \u201cNational Health Insurance Scheme\u201d. Another essential component of the new scheme is the development and deployment of district level health insurance management information systems. Finally, a draft ICT Policy for the Health Sector was developed in November 1999. This draft policy sought"}

The document proved useful, and some pertinent sections have been included in this new policy. 3 2. HEALTH SECTOR AND ICT \u2013 THE CURRENT SITUATION The successful implementation of an ICT policy and associated strategies can be ensured by focussing on, and systematically addressing the following challenges: 1) ICT Infrastructure and Services (a) Network Infrastructure and Internet Access (b) Hardware and Software (c) Security and Data Protection (d) Health Information Management Systems 2) ICT Human Resources Capacity 3) The Private Healthcare Sector 4) Planning and Funding 2.1 ICT Infrastructure and Services Network Infrastructure and Internet Access The deployment of a network infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for any ICT strategy. The existence of a network facilitates the sharing of resources and computing peripherals like printers, fax machine, dissemination of information via websites, the use of telemedicine facilities and other advanced telecommunication products. The health care sector in Ghana is not fully connected within itself or to any nationwide network system. There is inadequate networking at the national, regional or district levels and among private health care providers. Even though most health facilities and institutions make extensive use of computing and communication equipment, networking via wireless or cable technology and harnessing of the potential of the Internet highway have not been fully achieved. Thus, data is not electronically exchanged within the health sector. The Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS) project, which is part of the government financial management reform programme, has deployed local area networks at all Regional Health Administration and Regional Medical stores. The wide area network (WAN) is only operational in the Greater Accra region. Some health facilities have undertaken an appreciable level of networking of the revenue collection points and pharmacies. The absence of"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy_7", "text": "a health sector network infrastructure is part of a bigger national problem. There is no national telecommunication backbone in Ghana. Reports on the telecommunications sector indicate that telephone mainlines are 13 per thousand, 21 cellular phone subscribers per thousand and an Internet use of 7.8 per thousand3. According to the National Communication Authority (NCA), there are 363,103 fixed telephone lines and 8,843 payphones, thus the incidence of 4 telephone services is a dismal 20 per one thousand Ghanaians. The situation is compounded further by the relatively low proliferation rate of telecommunications services in the rural areas. Although 70% of all Ghanaians live in the rural areas, estimates are that 55% of fixed phone lines are found in the urban areas. Like their counterparts in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ghanaians are increasingly turning to mobile telephony as a solution to their communication needs. The use of mobile telephony is currently 21 cellular subscribers per thousand and this rate is projected to increase significantly in the current decade. However, the cost of mobile telephony effectively excludes the poor from taking advantage of the current telecommunications trend. Moreover, in the absence of adequate telecommunications infrastructure, an over-reliance on mobile telephony among the general population might stultify people\u2019s attempts to exploit the Internet. As expected, Internet cyber cafes are common in the major urban areas but are virtually non-existent in the rural areas. This is due to several problems, including the lack of electricity, bandwidth issues, and financial operating costs. Although the Government of Ghana is making progress in providing electricity to rural areas, there are still substantial numbers of villages in the rural areas, especially in the fifty-five poorest districts, that have no access to electricity. With regard to bandwidth issues, Ghana\u2019s major telecommunication provider, Ghana Telecom (GT), is an investor in the SAT 3"}

This can provide networking and communication services over analog or digital lines at speeds ranging from 4Mbits/sec to 155Mbits/sec. However, this capability has not been exploited. Communication using radio frequency has been deployed in some regions and districts. The coverage of the radio frequency communication is restricted because of the disparate frequencies among regions and districts. Hardware and Software Implementation of ICT strategy requires the use computing equipment, software application, communication devices and personnel with technical and functional skills. The standardization of specification for hardware, printing communication equipment and its consistent application, compatibility of operating systems coupled with the use of common protocols for radio communication and availability of technical support are a critical success factor for any ICT project. Standardization and the specification of hardware and software at the Ministry of Health and its agencies have not been reviewed in line with the rapid technological changes. Procurement of computing equipment and peripherals use in service delivery and emerging service needs like the NHIS and other software demands are not well co-ordinated because of inadequate technical knowledge. 5 Issues like functionality, technical support and availability of spare equipment parts and ultimately integration or networking with other systems are not considered in the decision-making process. Although a schedule for planned preventative maintenance exists, low emphasis is placed on the maintenance of ICT equipment. An institutionalised planned preventative maintenance of ICT equipment is urgently needed. This plan will not only safeguard investment in the infrastructure, but also will ensure the equipment\u2019s smooth operational functionality until the end of its useful life. The Ministry of Health has an Information technology (IT) Unit that provides support for hardware, software applications, multimedia and desktop publishing to all the administrative office within the MOH/GHS complex.

Consequently, the MOH IT unit plans to train and establish ICT focal points in each of the 10 regions. Security and Data Protection Security with respect to granting users access to data and information, accessing and manipulating data and information over an extensive network needs to be addressed. Maintaining the integrity of data and information requires detailed and extensive planning. Security breaches and systems failures with its attendant loss of information, loss of privacy and high cost of recovery poses a major challenge. The use of antivirus software for protection against computer viruses, firewalls and intrusion detection systems for filtering access to information, use of passwords for authentication, formulation of disaster recovery plans, routine backup procedures, deployment of software updates, documentation on all ICT infrastructure are a few of the best practices for security and data protection. Keeping proper documentation on ICT facilities like network topology and computing equipment register has not been done. Also, safeguarding ICT equipment from pilfering and theft, access to patient\u2019s electronic records and its legal implications have not been addressed. Cyber criminality is rising in proportion to the increasing use of the Internet. Fear of software security breaches hinders the progress of ICT especially in healthcare. No framework has been outlined for dealing with patient data confidentiality and protection in Ghana. This poses a serious threat to the implementation of any ICT policy in the health sector. 6 Health Information Systems Development There are very few electronic information management systems in use within the public sector in Ghana. The following systems are deployed within the public healthcare sector: \uf0b7 Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS): BPEMS is a government-wide system introduced by the Ministry of Finance.

Five ministries, including MOH, are directly connected to the system\u2019s database. \uf0b7 A District Health information System has been designed and deployed for capturing routine data, a quarterly TB data and a client satisfactory survey data at the district level. \uf0b7 Non-routine data such research reports are not available online. Several bespoke applications are also being used for reporting purposes by parallel programs. However, the systems designed are fragmented, small and not designed to support networking or integration into other systems. Thus within the public health sector, financial, clinical and patient-based systems are not integrated. The architecture available does not allow for distributed data access and is not intended to form an integrated health information management system. Emergency response and tracking systems based on integrated networks and database systems for disease surveillance and control and ambulance service are non-existent. Criteria for data collection and collation between the private and public and among other stakeholders in the healthcare industry have not been standardized. Most importantly, there is no system that supports the flow of information between the public and private healthcare sectors. 7 2.2 ICT Human Resources Capacity The shortage of IT professionals with the appropriate IT skill sets poses the most significant challenge to the effective implementation of an ICT policy in Ghana. There are relatively fewer ICT professionals in Ghana as compared to"}

The public healthcare sector\u2019s ability to attract and retain highly skilled IT professionals is limited due to its comparatively low salary levels. Attention has not been given to the following human resources issues linked with the deployment of ICT. 1 Availability of IT professionals (hardware, network and systems administrators, database administrators and help desk support staff). 2 Recruitment procedures, placement in the organization and mechanism for retaining IT staffs. 3 Mandatory ICT training for all health sectors personnel and person undergoing training at any healthcare institution. This will accelerate and promote the full use of ICT. 4 Health training using eLearning components like telemedicine, CD- ROM-based, Network-based, Intranet-based or Internet-based. 5 Health education on preventative care. 2.3 The Private Healthcare Sector The private health sector in Ghana is a vital and growing source of healthcare delivery and pharmaceutical services. It is estimated that the private sector provides about 42% of the healthcare services in the country. However, an effective partnership between the public and private health sectors is non- existent despite the overwhelming presence and importance of the private sector. The public sector acknowledges this, and has stated the following challenges in its 5YrPOW: \uf0b7 The scope of the private sector is not clear \uf0b7 Collaboration between the Ministry and private practitioners in providing service is still on a volunteer or ad hoc basis \uf0b7 The engagement of NGOs, in both policy formulation and implementation is still limited and mainly involves international rather than local NGOs \uf0b7 The MOH Private Sector Unit has limited capacity to develop strategies for wider private-public sector partnerships in core healthcare or in support services 8 \uf0b7 The potential to involve public sector health workers in intramural practice has not been explored in any detail In addition, the 2002 External Review Report"}

The most significant consequence of these challenges is the relatively low rate or lack of information exchange between the public and private sectors. For instance, very little is known about the following issues within the private sector: infection rates for priority health diseases, the cost of private healthcare delivery, traditional medicine and pharmaceutical issues. These challenges will also complicate the implementation of a health sector-wide ICT policy. It is crucial that the public sector engages the private sector in the implementation of the ICT policy, taking into account the particular financial and operational issues that plague the private sector. It should be noted that the public sector enjoys a relatively good partnership with the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG). This will prove particularly helpful since CHAG is currently developing and implementing its own ICT policy and strategy. 2.4 Planning and Funding The 5YrPOW list the following as strategies to achieve the public sector\u2019s objective of improving the use of information technology: \uf0b7 Streamline the deployment and use of ICT to the implementation of the ICT policy \uf0b7 Develop in-service training for staff to improve capacity for using technology \uf0b7 Develop multimedia mechanisms for dissemination of information and improvement of communication in the health sector, increased use of the Internet and local area networks to improve internal and external communications for BMCs The development of these strategies has been slow because apart from stating the strategies in the 5YrPOW, very little attention and planning have been given to their implementation. It has been observed that planning"}

Indeed, the previous ICT Policy and Strategy for the Health Sector in Ghana was not 9 implemented in the sector. There has been a lack of corporate will in furthering an ICT agenda in the health sector. This has resulted in very poor planning and budget for ICT activities in a sector overburdened with financial and operational issues. In some instances, ICT is seen as a luxury, as opposed to a necessary tool to enhance and improve healthcare delivery in the country. 10 3. HEALTH SECTOR OBJECTIVES AND ICT \u2013 THE CASE FOR THE STRATEGY The Ministry of Health, in consultation with its agencies, development partners and the private sector, developed the first 5-Year Programme of Work (1997- 2001) within the framework of the government\u2019s Medium Term Health Strategy. A review of the 5YrPOW I in \u201cThe Health of the Nation\u201c report revealed that while improvements were achieved, for instance in under-five mortality and immunization rates, a number of significant problems worsened. These problems include: \uf0b7 A low availability and use of government health and health related interventions \uf0b7 Growing financial barriers to access which excluded poor people from taking advantage of available health services \uf0b7 The health care delivery system had not been responsive to consumer needs \uf0b7 A high loss of human resources from the sector which was almost equal to the number of people being trained \uf0b7 Generally low productivity in the sector \uf0b7 The per capita expenditure on basic health service was below the level necessary for good service provision \uf0b7 Limited integration of the private sector for service delivery These prevailing problems informed the development of the second 5-Year Programme of Work, which is an integral component of the Ghana Poverty Reduction"}

The key priority issues for healthcare in the GPRS are: \uf0b7 Bridging equity gaps in access to quality health care and nutrition services \uf0b7 Ensuring sustainable financing arrangements that protect the poor \uf0b7 Enhancing efficiency in service delivery The GPRS classifies women, children, the disabled, the elderly, and people living with HIV/AIDS as vulnerable and excluded groups, and also identifies Northern, Upper West, Upper East and the Central Regions as priority areas. The second 5-Year Programme of Work also expanded the definition and scope of the health sector to \u201cinclude government health services, private, traditional and non-governmental providers, civil society, and community groups\u201d, and insisted that \u201ca well-functioning health system also depends upon collaboration and partnership with other ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) whose policies and services have a major impact on health outcomes\u201d. 11 The vision of the second 5-Year Programme of Work titled Partnerships for Health: Bridging the Inequalities Gap is the improved overall health status and reduced inequalities in health outcomes of people living in Ghana. The strategic objectives of this vision are: \uf0b7 To increase access to health services \uf0b7 To improve quality of health delivery \uf0b7 To improve the efficiency of health services delivery \uf0b7 To foster partnerships in improving health \uf0b7 To improve financing of the health sector Information, communication and technology can make a significant contribution to the realization of these strategic objectives. Firstly, education and information are essential for health promotion, improvement in quality of life, disease control, health administration and management. According to the African Development Forum, while the global stock of medical knowledge has grown, access to good health information within the African health sector and by African health care professionals has decreased substantially4. This is most unfortunate in a sector that is so heavily dependent on good,"}

Secondly, information and communication technologies can be used to promote better health behaviour, to promote exchange of information among peers in the health sector, to enhance evidence-based decision-making, improve financial management, improve efficiency, and empower communities to make informed choices about their health. In the current technological environment, all aspects of healthcare can be enhanced by information and communication technology. However, in the context of the above objectives, the deployment and use of information and communication technology presents several challenges. Primarily, the strategies require that systems should be put in place to ensure that the sector is able to respond to local health needs. It is also important that, whilst building the ICT capacity to respond to local health needs, the sector also ensures that the methods of performance assessment are included in the routine data collection, analysis and dissemination processes. Increasing access to health services Access to health services, especially in the rural areas, is very limited. In certain areas, particularly in the northern sector, over 70% of the population do not have access to health services. Factors such as an insufficient number and quality of service delivery points at the local level, a weak referral system and a poor transportation infrastructure contribute greatly to this low level of access. Specialist support to the regions, district and sub-district levels is lacking. Health facilities in rural areas only provide partial services because over 80% of 12 specialist services are concentrated in the regional capitals, and other urban centres. Indicator figures for 2004 show that the national doctor to population ratio as 1:17,615 and the national nurse to population ratio as 1:1,5135. These figures, already very low, are projected to decrease substantially in this decade as Ghana struggles with a crippling shortage of healthcare professionals. Access to"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-ICT-Policy-and-Strategy_16", "text": "health services is also constrained by the need to travel long distances to reach primary facilities. On average, over 40% of the population live beyond one-hour travel time to a health facility. In most of these areas outreach services are few and far between. The strategies adopted to overcome these constraints include: \uf0b7 Improving geographical access through the building of new facilities such as the Community Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS), and the introduction of specialist outreach services, increased access to emergency and primary services, and reviewing patient emergency transfer facilities. \uf0b7 Improving financial access through district health insurance schemes, focusing public expenditure on a priority package of health interventions \uf0b7 Improving socio-cultural access by ensuring the appropriate access to services for priority groups (e.g. women, children and the disabled) All these strategies have large recurrent implications, and the mounting costs may affect expansion in the long run. However, information and communication technologies will help in bringing specialists skill to the district and sub district levels, and also provide policy makers with a clearer understanding of the health problems at the these levels for more precise planning and programming. In addition, ICT can improve access to primary health care through telemedicine applications community health information systems that can monitor health status, identify community health problems and promote the appropriate responses; and through the dissemination of health information by radio and video transmission, and on the Internet. Improving quality The low level of technical competence, a poor handling of emergencies, as well as frequent shortages of drugs and medical supplies have been identified as major barriers to quality care. The underlying causes include the low level of skill among health workers at the periphery, poor physical infrastructure, mal- distribution of staff, lack of supervision, monitoring, and regulation of staff and"}

The strategies to overcome these barriers include efforts to improve staff skill through basic and in-service training, improvement of transport and communication systems, redressing the unfavourable distribution 13 of staff, the development and promulgation of a Citizens Health Charter, and strategies to improve the sector\u2019s responsiveness to client needs. The above strategies will take a long time to really have the desired effect of ensuring a minimum quality of care standard across the country. In this regard, a constant and sustained support from the central and regional levels will be required as a means of bridging the quality gap. Information and communication technologies will need to be deployed to facilitate skill transfer, enhance service supervision, and enable a rapid response to emergencies and adverse health events even in very remote areas. Improving efficiency The Ministry of Health headquarters functions as a conglomerate of different agencies. Each of these divisions and units has its own programmes, which are independently developed and implemented. This has led to a duplication of efforts, inefficient use of resources and lack of synchrony in programmes and agencies. Coupled with this problem is the absolute lack of information on programmes of the various divisions. This state of affairs can be generalized across the entire health sector, public and private. The lack of adequate, organized, reliable and timely information leads to the mismanagement of the health of patients, resources and time. In addition, the non-existence of an adequate system to manage and disseminate information hampers the efficiency of the sector. The sector has identified improvements in cost effectiveness, planning, management and administration as strategies to combat systemic inefficiency. Information and communication technologies will need to be employed as a means of managing and disseminating information. For example, a health information system that integrates electronic patient"}

However, in the face of limited resources, there is the need to put in place minimum standards to ensure systems compatibility and cost efficiency. Fostering partnerships in health There is a growing private health sector (including missions) without adequate regulation, control and integration with the public sector even though 40% of 14 people who seek healthcare do so from them. This private/public sector non- relationship is worsened by the lack of information and collaboration across the entire health sector, which in turn has resulted in a duplication and dissipation of efforts, a lack of holistic planning and an inefficient implementation of health programmes. The sector\u2019s strategy is to bring all sectors on board to plan and implement health programmes. Contractual agreements and procedures will form the basis for most of the programme implementation arrangements. The pooled donor funds arrangements imply that donor involvement in programme implementation will be limited. Information to support further assistance will therefore have to come from the overall performance assessment exercise. For the majority of stakeholders, the need for information will be more frequent than the annual review programme. This will require a system of information dissemination and sharing over a wide area and involving large amounts of current information. This demand can effectively be met by taking advantage of information and communication technology. Increasing funding to the health sector Funding to the health sector has persistently been low over the last decades. The total expenditure on health has averaged about $14 per capita with about 50% being out-of-pocket payments. The linkage between capital development and recurrent"}

The sector\u2019s strategy is to ensure that absolute funding to the sector is increased through both government budgetary allocation and donor support with a concurrent shift of resources to the district level. The increasing burden of out-of-pocket payments led to the launched National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in September 2004. The role of Information and communication technology in this regard is crucial and varied. A conscious effort must also be made to ensure that closer monitoring is effected at the periphery so that the objectives of resource shift are met. The health insurance scheme will require an extensive record keeping system, which can only be managed with the support of information technology. Ultimately, the sector must be able to market itself to the outside world, in order to attract donor funding. 15 4. GHANA ICT FOR ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT (ICT4AD) OBJECTIVES FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR The vision of the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) is to: \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people of Ghana by significantly enriching their social, economic and cultural well-being through the rapid development and modernization of the economy and society using ICTs as the main engine for accelerated and sustainable economic and social development\u201d. ICT4AD\u2019s main mission is to: \u201ctransform Ghana into an information-rich knowledge-based and technology-driven high income economy and society\u201d. The ICT4AD policy document states the following objectives for the health sector: 1. To improve the health status of the population while focusing efforts on reducing inequalities in health. 2. To promote the implementation of telemedicine applications within the health delivery system. 3. To integrate and deploy ICTs in health program delivery with targets for health education, training and preventive detection. 4.

To improve the efficiency of health service delivery, improving cost effectiveness and planning, management and administration. These objectives have been subsumed into four main thematic areas for the purpose of developing strategies. These areas are infrastructure development, access to and management of health information, access to quality health services and human resources development in ICT. The following section presents strategies under the four thematic areas. 16 5. THE ICT STRATEGY FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR 5.1: ICT4AD Health Policy Statement The Government of Ghana is committed to implementing a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating the widespread deployment and utilization of ICTs to support the activities and the operations of the health delivery system through out the country. As part of this commitment, the Government shall: \uf0b7 Invest in ICT-based healthcare systems to ensure that all Ghanaians have access to adequate, appropriate and timely healthcare services; \uf0b7 Facilitate the deployment and implementation of ICT-based programs that efficiently and effectively utilise scarce human resources in healthcare delivery system; \uf0b7 Partner with private sector and civil society in the deployment and utilisation of ICTs in the health sector; \uf0b7 Develop legal, regulatory and ethical frameworks for effective use of the health information and implement measures to safeguard the privacy of patient information; \uf0b7 Use ICTs in the management and treatment of malaria, HIV/AIDS, maternal reproductive health, other diseases and pandemics. 5.2 Goal The development and implementation of an information and communication technology (ICT) programme to transform the entire health"}

This inter- and intra-connectivity must enhance communication for all segments of the health sector regardless of location, particularly distance from the major urban areas. This communication network must be integrated, secure, fully interoperable with other networks, and must provide connectivity and access to the Internet for all professionals, workers and consumers in the health sector. Strategy 1.2: Provide adequate ICT hardware, software and tools at all levels of the healthcare delivery system to support the collection and use of healthcare information. All types of health institutions and all classes of workers shall be provided with the appropriate and adequate technological tools, both hardware and software, to support and enhance service delivery and management. Objective 2: Improve the Access to and Management of Health Information. The ultimate goals of this objective are the improvement in health outcomes of healthcare consumers, and the increased efficiency and effectiveness of health services. The ICT4AD policy and objectives for the health sector clearly state that the access to and dissemination of preventive health information are key factors for combating national health threats. A number of diseases have been identified by the health sector as priority diseases targeted for control or eradication in the medium term. This is due to \u201ctheir actual impact on health or because of the current large disparities in health outcomes between regions, and between urban and rural areas\u201d. These diseases collectively pose the greatest disease burden but are most easy to prevent, eradicate or cure. The priority diseases are: \uf0b7 HIV/AIDS/STI \uf0b7 Malaria \uf0b7 Tuberculosis \uf0b7 Guinea worm \uf0b7 Poliomyelitis \uf0b7 Reproductive, maternal, and child health \uf0b7 Accidents"}

Not surprisingly, the urban and rural poor pay the greatest price, both in health outcomes and in actual financial costs, for this health informational vacuum. ICTs can be used to disseminate a wide array of health information from basic health care issues to environmental sanitation practices. This will empower consumers to make informed decisions about their health. The health sector needs information of the highest quality for evidence-based transactions and decision-making. Challenges such as the lack of reliable information, not knowing when and where information is needed, and not knowing how to effectively use the information even when it is available, are all major barriers to the provision of quality health services and most importantly, results in decreased inefficiency and effectiveness (in cost and services) of the sector. Conversely, the manner with which health data and information are managed is a critical determinant in improving cost-effectiveness of health care services. Strategy 2.1: Develop and Deploy a System of ICT-based Programs to Disseminate Health Information A system of ICT-based Health Dissemination programs will be developed and deployed over the entire nation. It will be accessible to all types of health information consumers and users, including but not limited to patients, healthcare workers, researchers and students. Special emphasis will be placed on making both the content and the modes of delivery of health information accessible to vulnerable groups such as women, children, the disabled, the elderly, and the rural poor. The system of programs will be conceived in a manner that allows for and depends on extensive participation by the mission institutions, quasi government institutions,"}

Examples of the types of ICT- based programs of a Health Information Dissemination System are: \uf0b7 A web-based Health Information Portal for health consumers \uf0b7 An evidence-based Health Research Information website \uf0b7 A Youth Health Information Network that includes websites, radio and television transmissions \uf0b7 Disease management information on different portable and storage devices Strategy 2.2: Develop and Deploy a Network of Health Information Management Systems A network of Health Information Management Systems will be developed and deployed for use across the entire health sector. The principle aim of this strategy is to support the efficient management of the entire health sector. However, the nature, scope, and size of the network will differ or change over time depending on the availability of inputs such as funding, IT expertise and infrastructure.

It must be built in incremental steps using modular elements and thus should evolve from a network of stand-alone systems to a fully integrated eHealth information management system that makes extensive use of electronic health records (EHR). Objective 3: Improve Access to Quality Health Services. The goal of this objective is the use of ICT to decrease the widening health gaps between the rural and urban populations, and also between rich and poor citizens, through access to quality health services. Within the health sector, access to quality health services is impeded by several factors such as the dwindling number and the mal-distribution of health care professionals, an inadequate patient referral system and, a poor transportation infrastructure that hampers travel to and from health facilities over long distances. These factors also lead to an imbalance of supply and demand of health care services. The following strategies will improve access to quality health services by lessening the effects of the above factors on health status and outcomes. Strategy 3.1: Deploy Telemedicine Applications in the Health Sector. This strategy will introduce a telemedicine network throughout the country. Telemedicine has been defined as the use of information and communication technology to provide diagnostic and therapeutic medical information between patient and doctor without either of them having to travel.

Telemedicine can address the several problems that currently plague the health sector such as the brain drain among health professionals at all levels of service 22 delivery; the geographical mal-distribution of health professionals and by level of service delivery, the lack of continuity in services delivery, with poor referral mechanisms between levels and between non-government providers (NGP) and government services and; the underperformance of Ghana\u2019s hospitals resulting from excess capacity at district and regional levels and overcrowding at the tertiary level, largely with patients who could be treated more efficiently elsewhere. The telemedicine network will be used to \uf0b7 Promote and improve rural patient management; \uf0b7 Promote access to specialists for diagnostics in areas of chronic shortage including radiology, pathology, dermatology, ear-nose-throat speciality, emergency care/ambulance, cardiology, EKG-transmittance, physiology, endoscopy, surgery (e.g. neurosurgery and orthopaedics); \uf0b7 Improve consultation (Tele-consultation) between remote health workers and specialists in the above fields; \uf0b7 Support primary and home care (Tele-homecare) especially for homebound chronically ill and frail elderly persons whose mobility is limited by illness, transportation costs, or other factors.

Consequently, the Ministry of Health is fully committed to putting in place and facilitating the implementation of a comprehensive human resource development programme, targeting critical ICT skill areas across the health sector to support the development of the health delivery systems. Strategy 4.1: Provide training in ICT skills to all prospective and current health workers Future leaders and workers in the health sector must be well-versed and skilled in IT use. Whether clinical, public health, managerial or administrative, all workers in the health sector must be adequately familiar with information technology in order to perform efficiently in their jobs.

This program presupposes that the Government of Ghana will deploy a national network infrastructure to which the health sector can utilize. 2. Security, Privacy and Data Protection Program - This program will formulate procedures for deployment of network management and monitoring software, firewall and anti-virus software for securing the network from internal and external threats, and the tracking of access privileges. It will also ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, routine backup procedure and include an emergency recovery mechanism. Strategy 1.2: Provide adequate ICT hardware, software and tools at all levels of the healthcare delivery system to support the collection and use of healthcare information. 3. ICT Census \u2013 A census will be taken to determine the scope of ICT activities in the health sector at primary, secondary and tertiary institutions; and also at the national, regional and district levels. It will capture information on: \uf0b7 Range of hardware and software \uf0b7 Network Connectivity \uf0b7 Types of applications \uf0b7 Levels of ICTs utilization \uf0b7 Range of database management systems in use \uf0b7 Types of ICT programs e.g. Telemedicine \uf0b7 Number and skill set of ICT human resources \uf0b7 ICT or help desk support \uf0b7 ICT funding 4.

The guidelines for the design of the portal, how and what types of information are presented and update cycles will be developed by the all the partners in health sector. Some functionalities of the Portal will be: \uf0b7 Personalization and notification \u2013 allowing users to select and receive information relevant to their interests and roles. \uf0b7 Searching \u2013 the ability to search for information buried across multiple formats and sources. \uf0b7 Unified access \u2013 organizing and disseminating information assets, whether structured (databases, spreadsheets) or unstructured (e.g. documents, web pages). \uf0b7 Strict security models \u2013 ensuring various levels of security to ensure information is accessible yet protected. \uf0b7 Content submission and sharing \u2013 allowing collaborators to share valuable information in a simple, effective manner. \uf0b7 Intelligent classification \u2013 allowing the subject matter to be organized according to various standards and taxonomies (e.g. scientific, legal, public categorisation). \uf0b7 Common terminology \u2013 the portal will provide a medium to establish a common metadata repository, ensuring consistency in understanding of information. 6. Radio, Audio and Video Health Transmission Initiative \u2013 The goal of this initiative is the dissemination of health information to the portion of the population that are illiterate, who live in rural areas, and other people who may benefit from targeted specialized health information (such PWLHA, women, the disabled). The radio, audio and video programs will be produced by all segments of the health sector and will, most importantly, benefit from the involvement of non-governmental organizations and academic institutions. These programs can be broadcast at health, educational and social facilities. 27 7.

Strategy 2.2: Develop and Deploy a Health Information Management Systems Network 8. Consolidated Health Information System Initiative \u2013 A Consolidated Health Information System that consolidates existing health data that are already collected throughout the entire health sector will be developed and/or purchased and deployed across the health sector. This system will unify all the diverse public health surveillance software platforms currently in use by the parallel programs (EPI, Reproductive and Child Health, AIDS Control, Disease Surveillance, etc) in the health sector. This approach produces usable (and useful) automated support in a fairly short time frame (6-12 months). The system will include the following components: \uf0b7 A central repository or databank at the national level that will provide aggregated and disaggregated data for use by all authorized persons and non-private data for the general public \uf0b7 A set of agency-specific distributed and linked databases \uf0b7 A system of assuring quality and validation of data in the repository \uf0b7 Modules that provides for comprehensive and frequent feedback \uf0b7 Can be deployed over the Internet The Consolidated Health Information System must have an open architecture and be built on an open software platform to allow for modifications over time. The Ministry of Health will set the software and database management system platform in consultation with its agencies, other ministries, stakeholders and partners in the private sector.

For instance, the Hospital Management Information System, developed or purchased by Ghana Health Services, will be deployed 28 in all hospitals, including the Teaching Hospitals. This will ensure nation- wide compatibility. Private sector institutions, such as CHAG, other private hospitals and health-related NGOS can also use the system to collect, collate and analyse health data. It is expected that the initial set of systems will include: \uf0b7 Ghana Health Services Information System \uf0b7 Teaching Hospitals Information System \uf0b7 National Health Insurance Information System \uf0b7 Food and Drugs Board Information System \uf0b7 Pharmacy Information System \uf0b7 Nurses and Midwives Council Information System \uf0b7 Medical and Dental Council Information System \uf0b7 Private Hospitals and Maternity Homes Information System \uf0b7 Traditional and Alternate Medicine Information System \uf0b7 National Emergency Information System \uf0b7 CHAG Information System \uf0b7 Private Sector Information Systems Agencies and private sector users of the system will designate an authoritative source for all data entered into the system. The consolidated system must facilitate collaboration, information exchange and dialogue between the Ministry, its agencies and the private sector. The Ministry of Health will provide technical and financial assistance to agencies to adapt the system to their own mandates and contexts and will facilitate the corresponding process within the private sector. The Ministry of Health will also provide technical and financial assistance to BMCs for the deployment of the system, and will also support the training of staff in maintenance and use of the network of systems. 9. Hospital Management Information System (MIS) Project \u2013 The deployment of a Hospital MIS will be the first priority of the Consolidated Health Systems Initiative. The MIS will be chosen through competitive bidding and in full compliance with the country\u2019s procurement laws. The selected system will"}

Migration to Integrated Health Information System Project - A significant limitation of the consolidated system is the degree of integration of service information. In the consolidated system data are aggregated, usually at the facility or community level, before it enters the system. This tells us nothing about the clients, their socio-economic characteristics, or the quality and cost of services delivered, for example. This sort of analysis requires special studies such as surveys, or reconfiguration of the whole information system, including data capture forms. In theory, health sector information can also be correlated with information from other sectors such as education, agriculture, and commerce, to deal with issues such as malnutrition and to project future needs and opportunities. Such a system can also provide a foundation for countless research opportunities. An approach that integrates client information from multiple clinical encounters, and the resources used during these encounters, can capture information needed for this detailed analysis. This system requires a unique identifier per health record or data. It can be used to support regulatory functions such as licensing and accreditation, and can also form a basis for actuarial analysis leading to better estimates of the expected costs of health care. An integrated system like the one described is an evolving platform for recording and analysing information. It should not be based on any proprietary features, and should be fully complaint with international norms and standards for data, coding schemes and software. It must be built in incremental steps using modular elements. Migration to"}

Strategy 3.2: Deploy ICTs To Enhance Referral, Emergency and Disaster Management Systems 14. Radio-based Links Project- This project will introduce radio links between district health system sites and other health sites in close proximity (approximately 10 kilometer range). Strategy 4.1: Provide training in ICT skills to all prospective and current health workers 15. Health ICT in Educational Programs Initiative - The Health Sector will, in consultation with the Teaching Hospitals Councils, the five public universities and other public and private tertiary education and training institutions, develop and incorporate IT courses into their respective curricula. The curricula can offer a diverse number of courses on IT subjects that should include: o Basic computing skills o Internet and email o Biomedical Informatics 16. ICT Skills Set Project \u2013 The Human Resources Divisions with MOH and its agencies will develop an appropriate ICT skill set for each type of job function within the public health sector. 17.

It is therefore hoped that this collaboration will be enhanced in the implementation of these guidelines with each organization playing its rightful role in order to give the necessary impetus to ensure optimal OHS management for health care workers in Ghana. This it is envisaged will have spin-off effects for other sectors and indeed for workers in Ghana as a whole. We wish to acknowledge the tremendous contribution of members of the interdisciplinary committee that worked tirelessly to develop the document as well as the valued input and direction throughout the assignment by Dr. (Mrs.) Edith Clarke, Programme Manager, Occupational & Environmental Health Unit of the Ghana Health Service. We also acknowledge the input from Dr E.K. Sory, Director General of the Ghana Health Service, towards finalization of the document, the immense support provided by Dr. T. N. Awuah- Siaw, then Director, Institutional Care, as well as inputs from various health managers in the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service. ii FOREWORD Healthcare facilities are potentially hazardous workplaces that expose their workers to"}

Generally, it is assumed among healthcare workers and the general public that the greatest occupational health and safety risk faced by healthcare workers is infection resulting from exposure to blood and body fluids as well as infected air-borne aerosols. Skin contact, infectious fluids (via broken skin, mucous membrane) and droplets aerosols from patients exposes healthcare workers to infectious diseases such as hepatitis, HIV and tuberculosis among many others. Furthermore, the emergence of highly infectious diseases such as SARS and the H1N1 Influenza has the tendency to increase the infection risk dramatically. In addition to these, health workers are confronted with physical, chemical, ergonomic and psychological hazards. For instance, lifting and rolling immobilized or disabled patients exposes workers especially nurses to back injury. Besides, on call duty, high work load, verbal abuse from disgruntled patients, problematic work relationships, frustrations due to limited resources, poor remuneration among others, exposes healthcare workers to psychological hazards such as stress, depression and burnout syndrome. It is in view of the fact that the health worker is the most important resource in the process of rendering health care that the sector considers it prudent to provide a safe and healthy working environment as far as reasonably practicable, for its staff in line with the 1992 constitution and the Labour Act 2003, Act 651. Being a rather new discipline in Ghana, implementation of occupational health services expected to be put in place will largely depend on training in occupational health and on- going information provision for staff. It is in this regard that this policy and guidelines on occupational health and safety for health workers outlines evidence-based measures for adoption by health service managers and staff of institutions in the health sector both within the public and private sub-sectors. Similarly, on-going monitoring"}

OHS Occupational Health and Safety 1 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Nature and Magnitude of Work-Related Injuries and Ill-Health Health care workers of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) attend various hospitals and clinics when they fall ill. The Service however does not have a system to collect and collate information on hospital attendance and illnesses suffered by its staff. The sector is therefore not in a position to analyze the incidence of diseases among its staff and to tease out those that may have derived from their work and work conditions. The fact that the health workers attend several different health facilities and the potential breach of confidentiality associated with disclosure of medical information of clients makes it difficult to obtain information in this respect. This therefore makes it difficult to determine the contribution of workplace factors to ill-health among health workers. Health care"}

Those most at risk are those whose activities entail exposure to blood and blood products. Important blood \u2013borne pathogens in this regard include Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV/AIDS. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that Sharps injuries contribute 30% of new cases of HBV and 2.5 % of annual infections of HIV among health care workers in Sub-Saharan Africa (WHR 2002). Important predisposing factors found to account for these trends include needle stick injuries resulting from recapping of needles with two hands and contributory factors such as an overuse of injections. (Over 75% of injections used in curative sector are deemed unnecessary). Other patient and health care worker behaviors\u2019 also contribute to sharps injuries. In Ghana, this was borne out by a preliminary assessment of \u2018injection safety and health care waste management\u2019 conducted in 2003 which showed that despite the use of auto disable syringes in the administration of immunizations, a considerable number of immunization staff reported having sustained needle stick injuries which mostly occurred when a child moved suddenly during an immunization. This excludes the curative sector where safe injection devices have not yet been introduced and injections are estimated to be in the region of over five times those administered for immunizations. Staff are therefore considered to be at a higher risk of needle stick injuries. In Uganda and South Africa, needle stick injuries were found to be around 44-55% and 91% respectively among junior doctors over a 6 month period. The risk of needle stick injuries though not known precisely for Ghana may be of similar magnitude. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that a fair number of health workers have contracted and some have died from complications"}

Some studies carried out by the Occupational and Environmental Health Programme of the GHS show that not only do workers work under conditions that are hazardous to their health, but the staffs are also not sensitized to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) issues. 2 i. One of these studies was carried out among female nurses in 2 public health institutions in the Ablekuma sub-metro of Accra namely, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and Mamprobi Polyclinic to determine the occurrence of musculoskeletal diseases. The study found that nurses consider the spine as the body part mostly affected by their work. The specific parts mentioned in the order of predominance are lower back (65.4%), neck (63%) and upper back (37%). Table 1 shows the nurses\u2019 actual experience of the injuries. Table 1: Musculo-Skeletal Disorders Body Part Nurses mentioning part Nurses who actually suffered injury Spine 67.7% Lower Back 65.4% 65% Neck 63.0% 63% Upper Back 37.0% 37% Nurses interviewed identified lifting of patients (79%); poor working postures (77.2%); stress (68.5%); slips and falls (48.0%); haulage and transport [e.g., of supplies / food within facility] (45.7%) as activities or situations that constitute hazards in their work place. The study found that 78% of nurses were overweight. This is probably due to the sedentary nature of the work of some, and poor eating habits that may be aggravated by shift work. Whilst 43.1% of the respondents said there were no measures in place to control occupational hazards, as low as between 0.8% to 5.9% of respondents were aware of the measures in place. A summary of the responses in this regard is presented in Table 2. Table 2: Awareness of Measures to"}

Health promotion including information dissemination and education should be an integral part of the implementation of such a policy. Two other studies conducted by the same unit of the GHS assessed the physical conditions under which staff work, and the practice of OHS in health institutions in Ghana from the perspective of health workers. ii. The first study which employed observation techniques and environmental measurements in a regional hospital (Ridge Hospital), a district hospital (Tema General Hospital), two polyclinics/Urban Health Centres (Adabraka and Tema), a rural health centre (Amasaman), offices of a district health Administration (Amasaman) and the offices of the head quarters of the GHS was conducted in January 2005. A number of rooms that are in constant use by workers were surveyed for variables such as the area of room, lighting levels, temperature (as proxy for heat) and humidity. The main physical conditions investigated included illumination, temperature, and humidity. Other related factors were ventilation, sources of possible radiation, type and colour of walls, ceilings and curtain materials, air conditioners and fans, the number of windows per unit area of rooms, office space and room occupancy levels. Varying situations were observed between facilities and even within"}

Illumination was found to be poor with 73% of rooms being inadequately illuminated from natural sources and a comparative 76% being inadequately lit by artificial lighting sources. The colour of walls and the materials used for curtains and the manner of use did not help illumination. Poor lighting conditions may result in straining of the eye, cause headaches, easy fatigability and reduce the ability to quickly detect fast movements thereby increasing the risk of accidents. Internal temperatures and humidity were considered higher than desirable. Apart from the long term radiation risk associated with the use of computers, particularly for staff working in overcrowded offices and sitting in close proximity to the computers, their prolonged use also results in operator stress, fatigue, eye strain, sore and stiff neck, back and shoulder pains, wrist and hand injury, among others. iii. The primary objective of the Health and Safety survey in health care institutions carried out between July 1999 and April 2002 was to unearth the prevailing health and safety conditions in health care institutions, identify high-risk groups and to institute appropriate interventions to improve on current practices including a health surveillance plan for staff of the GHS. The cross-sectional exploratory study used structured interviews to assess safety breaches and type of ill health posed by conditions of work and the working environment. A total of one hundred and eighty-nine (189) subjects working in seven (7) government hospitals and health centres in the Greater Accra and Eastern regions of the country were involved in the study. In this survey, only 6% of health workers considered health and safety measures in place at the time of the survey adequate; 48% of the 4 respondents considered the measures to be poor and an additional 33% said they required"}

The reasons for the perceived poor health and safety performance included inadequate facilities and lack of safety equipment (18.5%), absence of Health and Safety Policy (14.3%), the cost of drugs being born by health care personnel (6.9%) and the lack of awareness of safety issues (5-8%). The survey indicated that biological factors (hazards), manual handling of patients and psychological stress were the three most common hazards in health care work. There was some variation in hazards identified among the various professional groups. Personal protective clothing comprising of gloves, facemasks and boots as well as caution at the personal level were the main measures adopted to mitigate the effects of hazards. Most of the personnel were unaware of any corrective measures taken after diseases or injuries have resulted, apart from first aid. There were no measures currently in place to monitor the various hazards on a routine basis to enable corrective measures to be instituted to address them. Though the prevalence of pre-employment medical examinations was over 77%, periodic and special medical examination were sparsely practiced and exit medical examination was and still is non-existent. 1.2 Legal Context of the Policy Section 24(1) of the 1992 Constitution states that \u201cEvery person has the right to work under safe and healthy conditions\u2026.\u201d This fundamental human right has been upheld by the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651).

Subsection (2) of the Section 118 specifies that: \u201cWithout limiting the scope of subsection (1), an employer shall (a) provide and maintain at the workplace, plant and system of work that are safe and without risk to health; (b) ensure the safety and absence of risks to health in connection with use, handling, storage and transport of articles and substances; 5 (c) provide the necessary information, instructions, training and supervision having regard to the age, literacy level and other circumstances of the worker to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety at work of those other workers engaged on the particular work; (d) take steps to prevent contamination of the workplaces by, and protect the workers from, toxic gases, noxious substances, vapours, dust, fumes, mists and other substances and materials likely to cause risk to safety or health; (e) supply and maintain at no cost to the worker adequate safety appliances, suitable fire-fighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and instruct the workers in the use of the appliances and equipment; (f) provide separate, sufficient and suitable toilet and washing facilities and adequate facilities for storage, changing, drying and cleansing from contamination of clothing for male and female workers; (g) provide adequate supply of clean drinking water at the workplace; and (h) prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, connected with, or occurring in the course of work, by minimizing the causes of hazards inherent in the working environment.\u201d Subsection (3), however, obligates"}

The Act in Section 119 protects the rights of a worker to remove himself or herself from any situation in the workplace which he or she has reasonable cause to believe presents an imminent danger to his or her life. In such cases, the Act forbids the employer terminating the employment of a worker or withholding his or her remuneration. An employer cannot require a worker to return to work in circumstances where there is a continuing imminent and serious danger to the life, safety or health of the worker. The Act also requires an employer to report occupational accidents and diseases which occur at the workplace as soon as practicable and not later than seven days from the occurrence to the appropriate government agency (namely the Factories and Mines Inspectorates respectively. Diseases should in addition be reported to the MOH / GHS). Finally the Act mandates the conduct of labour inspection to: (a) secure the enforcement of the provisions of the Act relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers at their workplaces, including the provisions relating to hours of work, wages, safety, health and welfare of the workers and the employment of young people; (b) provide technical information and advice to employers and workers concerning the most effective means of complying with the provision of the Act; (c) bring to the notice of the Labour Department or the Commission any defects of the Act; and 6 (d) report"}

Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, 1987 consolidates, with amendments, the law relating to compensation to workmen for personal injuries caused by accidents arising out of and in the course of their employment. It brings together the law on compensation to workmen. The basic provision is the principle of compulsory payment by an employer of compensation in respect of death or disablement of a workman as a result of an accident occurring in the course of his employment \u2013 independently of negligence on the part of the employee or fellow worker. The Law deals with the liability of employers for the payment of compensation to workmen as defined in the Law in respect of injuries resulting from accident, the amount of compensation to be paid in the various cases which can arise, the method of calculating the workmen\u2019s earnings for the purpose of determining the compensation payable and the persons to whom it is to be paid. The position with regard to occupational diseases is dealt with by a legislative instrument under Section 31 of the Law. Thirteen of such diseases are listed in the Third Schedule to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Regulations, 1967 (L.I. 546), for workmen\u2019s compensation purposes. The Law empowers the Minister responsible for Labour to extend the provisions of the Law to incapacity or death certified as caused by any disease specified in an instrument made under this section. International Conventions International declarations to which Ghana is a signatory also provide frameworks for effective promotion and enforcement of OHS standards. Examples of such international declarations ratified by Ghana include the following conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO): i. Convention 81 - Labour Inspection (02/07/59) ii."}

This includes the provision of appropriate facilities as well as premises for performing OHS activities including laboratories for carrying out performance testing and research as far as reasonably practicable. j) Use sound scientific management principles in the management of OHS at the institutional /facility level. k) Develop and implement appropriate strategic action plans (SAPs) to achieve the desired outcomes for service delivery including effective control of risks. 11 l) Extend the provisions of this policy to the protection from injury of clients that visit the health facilities. m) Institute a system for regular reporting on OHS at all levels of the health sector institutions and facilities and developing and circulating an annual report on the occupational health and safety situation in the health sector. 12 4 TECHNICAL GUIDELINES 4.1 General Principles Health and Safety management in the workplace is an on-going process that should constitute a core management function. Its success requires management commitment to health and safety, professional independence of the service, confidentiality and consultation among workers and management. In general, the integration of occupational health and safety (OHS) functions into the"}

The Labour Act 2003, and ILO Convention 155 on Occupational Health and safety and Convention 161 on Occupational Health Services, which require the employer to ensure that the work environment as well as systems of work are without risk to employees, and spell out components of comprehensive occupational health services. In the light of the hazards posed by work and work environment, and in line with the above tenets, the principles espoused below will constitute the essential characteristics of OHS management in health institutions and facilities throughout the country. The following general principles will therefore guide the operations of OHS: \u2022 Joint participation of employers and employees in the development of programmes for the improvement of the working environment; \u2022 Professional advice on planning and organization of work including the design of workplaces, the selection and maintenance of machinery and other equipment and substances used in health care work and its allied services; \u2022 Periodic reviews of occupational health and safety policy and guidelines based on new knowledge and research findings. Such periodic reviews will seek to identify major problems with the policy as a whole or in respect of particular areas, and evolve effective methods for dealing with the problems. The initial review should take place after the first 2 \u2013 3 years\u2019 of implementation of this policy 4.1.1 Management Commitment The health and safety of employees is the responsibility of management of institutions and health facilities at all levels of the health sector which will make health and safety a core managerial function and an integral part of their business. Leadership and genuine commitment of management provide an essential foundation for an effective health and safety programme. This should be reflected in the management\u2019s knowledge of the particular health and safety needs"}

This policy document will be signed by a high-ranking member of management such as the Director General of the service. Similarly, any health and safety guidance documents developed by health facilities/institutions to complement this health policy must be signed by the chief executive or head of the facility/institution. Management commitment should also be reflected in the allocation of adequate resources (material, human and financial) to ensure success in implementation of the policy. 13 4.1.2 Professional Independence in Delivery of Occupational Health Services Professional independence is the main ethical bedrock on which Occupational health services operates. This is demonstrated by who the occupational health personnel owes loyalty to, reports to and confidentiality. It must be clear that the primary responsibility is to his/her client who is the health worker. Any information about the worker patient can only be divulged to management with the consent of the worker. However pre-placement (pre- employment) medical exams by their nature imply the automatic consent of the worker. 4.1.3 Confidentiality Information regarding the health status of an individual health worker, obtained in the course of the discharge of OHS function shall be treated with the utmost confidentiality as should characterize health service delivery. 4.1.4 Consultation Consultation, which in this context refers to equitable participation of workers and management in OHS management, is an integral part of good management. It is a means by which employers and employees work together to improve health and safety in the workplace. In the spirit of bi and tripartitism, it should promote the culture of co-operation between the major stakeholders \u2013 government (MOH), employers and employees. This will translate into joint participation of employers and employees (bi-partisan) in the development of programmes for the improvement of the working environment. Consultation"}

Employee involvement in problem identification and related workplace changes also helps to ensure that employees are committed to changes. Opportunities should therefore be sought whenever possible for management-worker consultation through Health and Safety Committees. The following are examples of situations in which consultation may be employed: \u2022 Development of policies, procedures and action plans for the identification, assessment, and control of hazards in the workplace; \u2022 Review of accident statistics; \u2022 Solving of OHS problems; \u2022 Discussions on major Occupational Health and Safety issues; and \u2022 Procedures and methods for sharing information relevant to the health and safety of workers as it relates to their work. This list is however not exhaustive. 14 4.1.5 Professional Advice Professional advice will be sought on planning and organization of work including the design of workplaces, the selection and maintenance of machinery and other equipment and substances used in health care work and its allied services. 4.1.6 Policy Dissemination The policy will be widely disseminated and copies provided for all staff at post as well as new ones who join the service 4.2 Components of the Occupational Health Service In the light of the hazards posed by work and work environment, and based on the Labour Act 2003, (ACT 651), ILO Convention 155 on \u2018Occupational Health and Safety and Working Environment\u2019 and Convention 161 on Occupational Health Services respectively, which spell out the components of comprehensive occupational health services, the following five broad strategies will be adopted in the provision of occupational health services to staff of the health sector: 1.

Promotional activities including provision of information and education to employees to enhance their safety behaviours and adoption of habits that favour healthy lifestyles. 3. Curative activities that offer treatment and advice regarding injuries and diseases. 4.

Research activities which entail investigations and studies on the work environment, and into diseases and injuries as they relate to work and conditions of work. 4.2.1 Preventive Actions The preventive actions to be adopted are varied and go to complement each other in facilitating health and safety. They include the following: 4.2.1.1 System for Hazard Identification, Assessment, and Control Managements of the health sector shall ensure that hazards in the work environment are recognized through ONE SYSTEM that can be applied at all levels within the sector. This system should remain uniform throughout all facilities and institutions within the service to ensure that there is no confusion in the management of occupational hazards and risks. Each facility / institution should have an Occupational Safety and Health plan which shall outline the processes that staff and managers will utilize to identify, assess, and control hazards in 15 their working environment. The guidelines in Annex II will enable staff to assess the risk from hazards in the workplace. 4.2.1.2 Control of Hazards Once the hazard is known and the risk of it causing injury or disease is determined, then control measures should be applied in a hierarchical fashion. In taking action, the issues to address are: a) Can I get rid of the hazard altogether? b) If not, how can I control the risks"}

The principles below should then be applied as far as possible in the order in which they are listed: \u2022 Try a less risky option \u2022 Prevent / limit access to the hazard (e.g. to isolation ward, radiation exposed areas, guarding of beds with side rails to limit falls etc) \u2022 Organize work to reduce exposure to the hazard \u2022 Issue and ensure the use of personal protective equipment \u2022 Provide welfare facilities (e.g. washing facilities for removal of contamination and first aid). Caution \u2013 It is important to ensure that the control recommended / instituted does not pose another hazard 4.2.1.3 Monitoring the Control of Hazards Monitoring is defined as any action taken to determine the current state of a workplace, or worker, in relation to a significant hazard. Thus the monitoring function has the aims of determining the state of: \u2022 The work environment i.e. it assesses the intensity or level of identified hazards (physical, chemical, biological, & psychosocial) in the workplace environment; or \u2022 Workers\u2019 exposure to physical, chemical, biological hazards or psychosocial the workplace and come up with a Hazard Management Plan \u2022 The effect of the hazard on the worker manifest through ill health or injury.

It is a planned programme of systematic regular medical examinations designed to enable the early detection of disease or ill health related to particular types of work. It facilitates the ascertainment of the effectiveness of control measures. All staff members are expected to 16 undertake it.

Each institution is to have a surveillance plan which spells out the types and frequency of examinations to be undertaken and the different categories of staff to undertake the examination in the various sections of the institution, based on the likely potential hazards as listed in Annex 1. The medical monitoring protocol should be divided into 4 key areas namely: pre-placement, periodic, post sickness absence and exit. Each of the examinations will consist of the following procedure: \u2022 Completion of medical history form \u2022 Physical examination \u2022 Special Tests/laboratory investigations \u2022 Final assessment The emphasis in these examinations should be on ensuring that workers are fit for work in those areas for which they have been employed. A sample medical surveillance from is found in Annex 4. Informed consent is required from each employee before personal monitoring of his/her health is undertaken. As with any medical record, unless an employee gives specific permission (best given in writing) for results to be made available to the employer, the results of health surveillance / biological monitoring carried out on an employee remain confidential between the employee and the person who carried out the monitoring. The only results to which an employer shall normally have access are group results with personal identifiers removed. The various types of health screening are described below: i) Pre-placement (Pre-employment) Examination This examination is to ensure that the employee is fit to undertake the job without risk to himself or his colleagues. The baseline medical examination conducted at the start of employment will define the initial health status: Subsequent examinations will be used to evaluate the evident health effects of the work environment and other working conditions. ii) Periodic Examination This consists of examinations conducted periodically to identify vulnerable"}

The frequency and types of examinations will be determined for each vulnerable group based on nature of work, ages and sex of the group members. 17 iii) Post Sickness Absence Examination This is to ensure that an employee who has been absent with a medical condition for a considerable length of time is fit to undertake his/her usual job. On the other hand, it will facilitate the rehabilitation or temporary or permanent resettlement of those who are not fit to return to their usual occupations. iv) Exit Medical Examination This is to provide data on employees at the point of exit from a particular occupation or workplace. The advantage to employees is that it provides the opportunity for employees with ailments which have a causal relationship to any factor in the work environment to continue to receive assistance for managing it after they have left the employment or moved on to another schedule. 4.2.1.5 Prevention of Communicable Diseases All efforts should be made to limit the transmission of infections in the work place. Measures towards achieving this include the following: i) Immunization Strategy The GHS will implement a comprehensive occupational immunization programme for its employees who handle patients. Due to the risks of contracting infectious diseases from the work environment, all staff and potential staff members will be made aware and provided with appropriate immunizations. The most important diseases to be vaccinated against are: \u2022 Hepatitis B \u2022 Tetanus \u2022 Yellow Fever & Cerebro-Spinal Meningitisand other diseases where occupationally relevant For staff who have not been vaccinated in childhood (e.g. by virtue of coming from abroad), vaccination against the following may also be required and needs to be discussed with the occupational health department (or designated staff member)"}

MOH is committed to maintaining as far as possible the independence, dignity, privacy and confidentiality of clients while simultaneously assuring the safety of her staff. To ensure this, good practice of infection control based on the universal precautions approach should be followed at all times, not just where a specific risk is known. This 18 includes ensuring the highest standards of cleanliness, waste disposal whilst making provision for all the basic equipment, disinfectants, personal protective equipment and other consumables required for this. (Refer to the MOH Policy on Infection Control for the details). iii) HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis There will be appropriate screening for the blood borne pathogens with access to advice and support for healthcare workers who may be infected with the HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Such advice or support may be spelt out in appropriate policies e.g. HIV /AIDS workplace policy and other guidance relating to provisions for care and compensation for ill or injured staff proposed in this document and any others on staff welfare in use by sub- sectors, institutions and facilities. If exposure to Hepatitis or HIV/AIDS in the work environment through needle stick injuries or other factors resulting in contact with blood, blood products or body fluids is suspected, the incident needs to be reported immediately. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be provided and other actions taken as spelt out in the MOH HIV/AIDS policy and as detailed for potential exposures to HIV and Hepatitis in Annex of this"}

In serious cases, it may necessitate the withdrawal of services from the client/patient. 4.2.1.7 Accident and Incident Reporting A critical link in the health and safety programme is the ability of supervisors to investigate accidents and incidents (with the potential to progress into accidents) occurring in the workplace. The ultimate objective is to review all unsafe conditions to determine whether there are any control measures in place and whether they are performing as they should. Documentation of accidents and incident investigations should be done on forms appropriately designed for that purpose and communicated to staff and management. It is also a statutory obligation that accidents should be reported to the appropriate authorities. This action then leads on to finding solutions to prevent future occurrences. All accidents to staff, patients, and visitors reported through the Incident reporting system will be followed up and, where necessary, a new risk assessment undertaken. 4.2.2 Health Promotion Health promoting strategies to be adopted by the sector include education and training, counselling services and information provision in general lifestyle issues and on specific workplace exposures. 19 4.2.2.1 Education and Training Occupational Health and Safety training will be emphasized to ensure that staffs adhere to the appropriate practices which minimize adverse health and safety impacts. The training will also include reasons for the use of and care for PPE as well as information on diseases which are influenced largely by lifestyle factors e.g. Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension and HIV/AIDS.

Environmental management as well as work place safety plans should be required from contractors as part of their technical proposals before the award of contracts and their implementation should form a vital deliverable to be procured before payments are made. This may be integrated with the business plans submitted by the contractors. Where the gravity of environmental and safety risks so warrant, separate plans covering these should be developed and submitted by the contractors. 26 8 ALCOHOL AND DRUGS It is recognised that the use of alcohol and other drugs can affect work performance and the safety of staff. Alcohol abuse (Acute intoxication or alcohol dependence) and drug abuse ( taking a psychoactive drug or performance enhancing drug for a non-therapeutic effect) can cause job related injuries, increase absenteeism as well as reduced job performance and morale within the organisation. The aim of this policy is to provide a safe, healthy and productive workplace for health workers. All individuals therefore have a responsibility to avoid alcohol or other drug (particularly illicit drugs) use to the extent that it impacts adversely on work performance or safety. 8.1 Scope As a part of the occupational health and safety policy for health workers, this policy applies to all staff of the Ministry of Health (MoH), its departments and agencies as well as to contractors (and their employees) who may work on their premises. It further applies to health workers in quasi government, the private sector and health facilities operated by non \u2013 governmental"}

To achieve these aims, managers of facilities / employers should \u2022 provide suitable alcohol and other drug training to management, supervisors, employee representatives and other staff responsible for policy implementation \u2022 provide suitable alcohol and other drug information and education to all employees \u2022 ensure that alcohol or other drugs are not consumed during working hours or on work premises. 27 \u2022 assist and motivate employees with alcohol and/or other drug problems to access counseling and treatment services In Ghana, possession and use of illicit drugs is a criminal offence. On the other hand, the rights of individuals to drink socially is acknowledged, but when work performance suffers or individuals are endangered as a result of its use, then action must be taken. In the interests of occupational health and safety, action will be taken in the following circumstances: \u2022 when an individual is, through the consumption of alcohol or other drugs, in such a state as to endanger their own safety or the safety of"}

Any individual who is adversely affected by alcohol or another drug will not be allowed to work until they are deemed fit to safely and productively perform the job. iv. If an employee affected by alcohol or another drug is sent home to recover, they will not be paid for the lost time. v. Disciplinary action may be taken on return to work.: An individual found under the influence of alcohol during working hours will receive a written warning to stating that if it occurs again, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken by a disciplinary committee and penalties will range from interdiction with/ without salary to outright dismissal. 8.6 Illicit Drugs In Ghana, the growing, possession and use of illicit drugs - irrespective of the quantity \u2013 is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment. The following conditions will apply: i. Illicit drugs (e.g., cannabis, amphetamines and heroin) are not permitted on work premises or to be used during working hours under any circumstances. ii. An individual found in possession of, selling, transferring, distributing or manufacturing any substances known or suspected to be illicit substances in the workplace, will be handed over to the law enforcement agencies. If found culpable, the individual will be dismissed. 8.7 The Disciplinary Procedure Supervisors may become aware that an individual\u2019s work performance has deteriorated sufficiently to be of concern or that they have repeatedly placed themselves or others at risk of accident or injury. When a pattern of unsatisfactory work performance or situation of being on alcohol or drugs becomes clear the following measures will be adopted: i.

If a third interview is required, the employee will be given the option of obtaining help or facing the consequences (severe discipline in form of suspension, demotion or dismissal).This interview will be conducted by a disciplinary committee set up by the regional director of health services, or constituted by management in consultation with the local workers\u2019 union. 29 All information will be treated in strict confidence. iv. Where an employee is taking prescribed drugs and is unable to perform the work required of one, the supervisor / management /employer in consultation with the employee may make adjustments to the work requirements if reasonably practical. If this is not possible and the situation is temporary, the employee should go home on sick leave. If it is not temporary, further consultation and consideration of appropriate duties will be required. 8.8 Social Functions There may be certain occasions where alcohol is available at functions. On these occasions, the responsible serving of alcohol at social functions will apply. In addition, it is up to each individual to ensure that the consumption of alcohol is kept to relevant legal limits and that appropriate standards of behaviour are maintained. The following guidelines are to assist in planning and hosting MoH /GHS and other health service organizations\u2019 functions when alcoholic beverages are served. i.

Alcohol is not essential to any function. The use of alcohol is a personal choice. No one should feel pressured to either drink or not drink, and must not be made to feel uneasy or embarrassed as a result of their choice. iii. The MoH drug and alcohol policy shall be observed at all times (i.e., no return to work if under the influence of alcohol or other drugs). iv. The respective supervisor / employer / management shall encourage those who intend to consume alcohol at functions to use public transport or refrain from driving themselves. v. The person responsible for organising any event where alcoholic beverages are served is accountable for ensuring that alcohol is served in a manner, which limiting its potential to affect both health and safety by ensuring that an adequate variety and supply of non- alcoholic beverages shall always be visibly available. They should be presented in a manner that is as appealing as beverages containing alcohol. vi. If anyone is aware that a guest has had too much to drink he/she should contact the nominated person responsible for overseeing the function. The nominated person should attempt to provide supervised transportation home for that person. If in doubt about a 30 guest\u2019s condition that person will be discouraged from driving. If the nominated person is not available then individuals should attempt to provide supervised transportation. 31 9 FINANCING OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES (OHS) Medical surveillance and rendering of medical care for injuries and disease suffered by the worker should be at no cost to the worker. The cost should be borne by the employer through arrangements made in accordance with national conditions and practice. The MOH will ensure the availability of funds for OHS via"}

The eventual configuration of funding sources may include all or some of the above as practicable. 32 10 MONITORING OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAMME 10.1 Health and Safety Audit and Performance Review This is the final step in the health and safety management control cycle which effective organizations use to maintain and develop their ability to manage risks to the fullest possible extent. As a process, it aims to ensure that control measures are working and kept up to date. Auditing and performance review allow policy implementation to be assessed against four key indicators: \u2022 Assessment of achievement of specific objectives; \u2022 Assessment of compliance with health and safety performance standards; \u2022 Identification of areas where standards are absent or inadequate; and \u2022 Analysis of incident, accident, and ill health data. Programme review and evaluation should measure outcomes such as the attainment of goals and objectives, and programme effectiveness and should also analyze trends. The outcomes can be evaluated by using employee interviews and testing, observation of work practices to determine whether employees understand the health and safety policies and procedures. Programme effectiveness may also be evaluated by observing both overall and departmental trends in occupational injuries and illnesses. 10.2 Specification for"}

This should take place at least once in 3 years. 34 11 ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS 11.1 Ministry of Health (MOH) The overall responsibility for ensuring the implementation of this policy rests with the Minister for Health. The policy will be implemented in all sub-sectors of the health sector, with the administrative structure being based on the currently existing arrangements within these various sub-sectors. The health and safety policy will be implemented at all levels of the MOH i.e., Sub-district, District, Regional and National levels. The Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Directorate (PPME) and the Human Resources Directorate (HRD) will be responsible for putting systems in place for resource mobilization for specific programme components, implementation, and monitoring as well as periodic evaluation of programmes. To facilitate programme implementation, the Occupational and Environmental Health Unit (OEHU) will lead in the formulation of technical guidelines and in monitoring and evaluation. 11.2 Teaching Hospitals, CHAG, Private Health Institutions, MOH Subvented Organizations Responsibility for implementation rests with heads of these institutions (i.e. Chief Executives/ Directors of teaching hospitals, CHAG"}

The regional focal person will assist the OHS units where appropriate and facilitate the smooth running of their activities, including organizing in-service training programmes for health and safety committees and staff, conducting risk assessment, planning and execution of internal and external audits. 36 The ILO advocates the formation of Health and Safety Committees (HSC) by organizations to facilitate the inclusion of both management and employees in issues affecting Health and safety. In the health sector, a central HSC will be best placed at institutional level ie at health facility or RHMT/ DHMT level. Further, departments / units should also have their individual HSC from which representatives are nominated to serve on the central committee at (RHMT/DHMT). These representatives will serve as a mouth piece to promote safe work and working environments for their respective departments/unit. 11.3.3 District Level The administration of OHS will be handled by a District Focal Person for OHS. S/he will be responsible for planning and execution of programmes at the district. Activities will include sensitization, organizing in-service training for staff, collection, analysis and use of occupational health data. The focal person will report to the District Director of Health Services (DDHS). At the facility (District Hospital) level, the OHS function will be performed by the Occupational Health and Safety team made up of at least 2 members to be led by a senior public health officer.

S/he will collect data which will be collated and analysed and then transmitted to the DDHS. On a day to day basis, the responsibility for monitoring of this data will be delegated to the OHS District Focal Person. 37 Annex 1 Hazards in Health Care Work Environment Health Care Work is associated with numerous hazards both in the clinical care setting as well as in administration of various support services. The hazards are varied and may be classified according to the following major categories: \u2022 Biological Hazards: Examples of these are infections of varying aetiologies e.g. those caused by micro- organisms such as Viruses (HIV, Hepatitis B, C and D) bacteria like mycobacterium tuberculosis and typhoid, parasites e.g. intestinal helminths, and fungal causes. Other biological hazards include rodents and insects. The effects of common biological hazards are infections, parasitic infestations, and insect stings etc. \u2022 Physical Hazards: They include extremes of temperature, (cold/heat), poor lighting affecting vision, poor ventilation, radiation, faulty electrical wiring and other faults with the risk of electric shocks, noise, vibrations and explosions from pressurized containers. These hazards if not adequately controlled predispose staff to a deterioration of vision, radiation-induced malignancies, noise-induced hearing loss and injuries. \u2022 Mechanical Hazards: These include situations resulting in slips, trips and falls such as wet floors, slippery finish to floors, poor"}

These predispose workers to musculoskeletal injuries often affecting the back. \u2022 Chemical Hazards: It includes cleaning detergents, reagents (used in laboratory and other areas) anaesthetic gases, and drugs. These have the potential for causing contact dermatitis, allergies, colds and other ailments like asthma. \u2022 Psychosocial Hazards: Some important hazards in this category include stress, excessive workload, verbal and physical harassment, work organization lapses such as poor work arrangements and procedures, and poor interpersonal relationships. There is often interplay between these hazards and lifestyle such as wrong diets, poor timing of meals, and lack of physical activity. The long-term effects of some of these hazards include psychological disorders including drug abuse, alcoholism leading to neurosis and psychotic illness. Obesity combined with some of these factors cause an upsurge in the degenerative diseases like hypertension and heart disease. 38 ANNEX 2 Steps in Risk Assessment 5 Steps to assess the risk in your workplace Table 1 illustrates 5 steps to be taken in assessing risk in the workplace. It is necessary to seek the professional advice of Occupational Safety and Health practitioners in carrying out the assessment whenever in doubt and in situations where job design may have to be modified. Table 1: Steps in Assessing Risks in the Workplace. Step Action I: Look for the hazards II: Decide who might be harmed and how III: Evaluate the risks and decide whether the existing precautions are adequate or whether more should be done IV: Apply control measures V: Record your findings VI: Review your assessment and revise it if necessary Step I: Look for the"}

Ignore the trivial and concentrate on significant hazards which could result in serious harm or affect several people. Obtain the input of your employees or their representatives. They may have noticed things which are not immediately obvious. Manufacturers\u2019 instructions or data sheets can also help you identify hazards and put risks in their true perspective. So can accident and ill-health records. A summary of common hazards in the health workplace environment are provided in Annex 1 Please refer to this and other relevant policies and guidelines such as the MOH Workplace HIV/AIDS Policy and Health Care Waste Management Policy and Technical Guidelines for more information. Step II: Decide who might be harmed, and how In deciding who might be harmed the following categories of persons should be considered in addition to all workers: \u2022 Young workers, trainees, new and expectant mothers, etc, who may be at particular risk \u2022 Cleaners, visitors, contractors, maintenance workers, etc who may not be in the workplace all the time \u2022 Members of the public, or people you share your workplace with, if there is a chance they could be hurt by your activities. 39 Step III: Evaluate the risks The goal of this step is to decide whether the existing precautions are adequate or more should be done. Consider how likely it is that each hazard could cause harm. This will determine whether or not you need to do more to reduce the risk. Even after all precautions have been taken, some risks usually remain. What you have to decide for each significant hazard is whether this remaining risk is high, medium or low. Because the law also says that"}

If you find that something needs to be done, draw up an \u2018action list\u2019 and give priority to any remaining risks which are high and/or those which could affect most people. Appropriate control measures should be instituted commensurate with the level of risk. Step IV: Apply Control Measures In taking action, ask yourself: a) Can I get rid of the hazard altogether? b) If not, how can I control the risks so that harm is unlikely? Apply the principles below in the order in which they are listed, if possible: \u2022 Try a less risky option \u2022 Prevent / limit access to the hazard (e.g. to isolation ward, radiation exposed areas, by guarding of beds with side rails etc) \u2022 Organize work to reduce exposure to the hazard \u2022 Issue and ensure the use of personal protective equipment \u2022 Provide welfare facilities (e.g. washing facilities for removal of contamination and first aid) Caution \u2013 It is important to ensure that the control recommended / instituted does not pose another hazard Step V: Record your findings It is important and useful to keep a written record of what you have done i.e. you must record the significant findings of your assessment. This means writing down the significant hazards and conclusions e.g., blood spillages on floor, or \u2018side rails (guarding) absent from side of bed\u2019 \u2018electrical installations: insulation and earthing checked and found sound\u2019.

It can also remind you to keep an eye on particular hazards and precautions. And it helps to show that you have done what the law requires. Step VI: Conduct periodic review Periodically review your assessment so that you can take care of any factors that might have changed. This will enable you to ensure that the precautions you had taken remain relevant. All subsequent reviews should follow steps I to IV stated above and should be duly recorded for the stated reasons. 41 ANNEX 3 Vaccination for Blood \u2013 Borne Pathogens The common blood \u2013borne pathogens for which some vaccinations are available are the blood-borne viruses: Hepatitis B and HIV. 1.1 Hepatitis B (and C) Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) (and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)) in the workplace occurs in the following ways: \u2022 Accidental exposure to blood (AEB): Any contact with blood or body fluids as a result or injury with a needle that is contaminated with blood or blood products (needlestick injury) or any other sharp instruments, or via mucous membrane (eye, mouth), or contact via damaged skin (eczema, wounds). \u2022 Percutaneous exposure (PE): exposure to blood or body fluids through non-intact skin. \u2022 Blood splash: Skin visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids. \u2022 Exposure of intact normal skin to a large volume of blood. \u2022 Human bites.

Indications for hepatitis B vaccination include pre-exposure and post-exposure cases. 1.2 Procedure for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B Pre-exposure prophylaxis is advised for health workers exposed to blood and blood products. Immunization regime: The vaccination is indicated at 0, 1 and 6 months. Site of administration: Intramuscularly in the deltoid region or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and not in the gluteal region as it may reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. Dosage: Engerix B 20 micg or Recombivax-HB 20 micg Heppacine-B (plasma derived): 1 ml They are each administered at the stated 0, 1 month and 6 month intervals. Where testing facilities are available, testing should be done for Hepatitis \u2018B surface antigen and Hepatitis B antibody prior to initiating administration of the vaccine. If the antibody titer level is low or negative, Hepatitis B immunization can proceed. 1.3 Procedure for Post-Hepatitis B Exposure Prophylaxis Health personnel exposed to blood or body fluids by needle stick, cuts or bites should do the following: \u2022 Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. \u2022 The worker should be tested for Hepatitis \u2018B surface antigen and Hepatitis B antibody. 42 \u2022 If the antibody titer level is low or negative give booster does of Hepatitis B immunization. \u2022 For unvaccinated persons (unlikely to have had previous exposure to HBV) sustaining exposure to HBV, HBIG should be administered for immediate action. \u2022 Repeat tests after 1 month and then 6 months after the first test. \u2022 If the titer is still low, repeat the Hepatitis B immunization after a 3rd dose should not be assigned to high risk areas (e.g. area where blood specimens are handled, fevers units,"}

Treatment must be monitored by laboratory investigations. 1.5 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Preventing transmission of HIV in the workplace means complying with standard precautions, and providing post exposure prophylaxis after high-risk exposure to HIV. In the event of possible exposure to HIV the following steps should be taken immediately: \u2022 The wound site must be cleaned with soap and water or in case of mucous membranes, flushed with water. \u2022 If therapy is necessary, it should be initiated promptly, preferably, 1-2 hours post exposure \u2022 Report the incident immediately to the supervisor. Post exposure prophylaxis reduces the likelihood of HIV infection after high-risk exposure. PEP may either prevent the establishment of infection or prevent new infection while allowing clearance of already infected cells PEP is particularly effective within 1-2 hours of exposure and not more than 72 hours after exposure. Assessment of exposure to risk: Exposure to HIV can be classified into three stages. Very low risk is the splash of body fluid on intact skin. Low risk exposures are: - Exposure to small volume of blood or body fluid from asymptomatic HIV positive patient with low viral load. - An injury with a soiled needle 43 - Any superficial injury or mucocutaneous exposure. High-risk exposure is: - Exposure to large volume of blood or potentially infectious fluid. - Exposure to blood or blood contaminated fluid from a patient"}

As a general guide, the committee should be large enough so that the health and safety concerns of the entire workplace is represented for example a health facility with doctors, nurses, laboratory workers, pharmacy workers, drivers, security and kitchen staff should have each of these areas represented on the committee. Health and Safety committee is strongly recommended for any health facility with 20 or more employees. The head of the health facility / institution shall be responsible for establishing a health and safety committee when the above condition is met. This means causing the members to be chosen and setting aside a time and place for meetings. When is a Health and Safety committee necessary? There are only a few rules on how the H&S committee should operate. Thus the committee is free to decide its own procedures. These rules include: Mode of Operation \u2022 The committee must meet at least once every three months \u2022 It must be co-chaired by two members, one of them representing workers and the other management \u2022 Members are entitled to at least one hour of paid preparation time before each meeting or more if the committee decides, depending on the issues under consideration. \u2022 Members are also paid for time spent at meetings and for carrying out certain other committee duties. In other words, work of the committee should be regarded as part of their routine tasks. \u2022 The committee must keep a record of minutes of the meetings These minutes should be made available upon request by authorized inspector 46 ANNEX 5 Medical Surveillance Format MINISTRY OF HEALTH / GHANA HEALTH SERVICE MEDICAL EXAMINATION FORM"}

We also would like to thank the Hon. Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu (MP) and the Director for Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation for their advice and guidance during the development of this health information strategy. 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Health Sector recognises the need for quality information as an essential part of the health planning, management, and policy development processes. However, investments for creating the enabling environment, building infrastructure and capacity for health information management remain limited and uncoordinated. Absence of interoperability standards has also resulted in limited interoperability between diverse agency electronic systems, leading to very little information sharing among agencies; thus, negatively affecting informed decision- making. Therefore, this strategic plan seeks to set out the governance systems, the implementation and integration plans that will facilitate improved collection, analysis, access, and use of comprehensive quality health data across all the agencies of the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders. The proposed structure of the health information system includes transmitting health data generated from services delivery, regulatory, purchasing (health financing) and training institutions in the health sector to a national level database. A dashboard will be created for the Ministry of Health to track key performance indicators of the health sector for decision- making. The governance structure of the Health Information System will comprise Minister for Health, Inter-Agency Leadership Committee; Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Research, Statistics, and Information Management; Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation-Technical Working Group.

The implementation duration of the HSSP will take effect from 2022 to 2025 and it is estimated to cost about GHC30 million. It is our expectation that the implementation of this strategy will facilitate real time data capturing, analysis, and utilization for decision-making towards improving health outcomes of the population and reporting to global requests promptly. I therefore implore all stakeholders to work collectively to see to the realisation of the objectives of this strategy. 8 CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 1.0 BACKGROUND The health sector in Ghana has the goal of increasing access to quality essential health care and population-based services for all. There is a strong recognition of the need for quality information as an essential part of the health planning, management, and policy development processes. With the focus on performance, establishing an integrated and a functioning health information system is seen as a priority. However, investments for creating the enabling environment, building infrastructure and capacity for health information management remain limited and uncoordinated. This is compounded by continuing emphasis on programmes and projects. The consequences of these are that decision making, planning and measurements in the health sector are not adequately informed by available evidence. 1.1 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS Policy Context In developing the National Health Information System Strategic Plan (HISSP), several documents were taken into consideration. These included the National Health Policy (January 2020), Ghana\u2019s Roadmap for attaining Universal Health Coverage (2020-2030), the Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan (HSMTDP 2022-2025), Strategic Plans of the various agencies and programmes, among others. Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan (HSMTDP) 2022-2025 The HSMTDP for the Health Sector that will span 2022-2025 has the following key strategic objectives: 1. Universal access to a better, efficiently managed,"}

Reduce avoidable maternal, adolescent and child deaths and disabilities 3. Increase access to responsive clinical and public health emergency services The HISSP will be used to facilitate the generation of indicators to monitor the implementation of the HSMTDP and other on-going programmes. Organisation of Health Services in Ghana The Ghana health sector is pluralistic, comprising public, private and quasi-government health providers. Health services are organized at the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Levels and administratively operate at the National, Regional, District and Sub-district levels, as shown in Figure 1 below. 9 Figure 1: Health services provision architecture of Ghana Service delivery is supported by agencies that provide training, regulation, purchasing of health services and research services. The routine administrative health service data collection is skewed towards health care delivery. Although training of health care professionals, regulation, health financing, research and other non-service delivery activities generate a lot of data, very little of these go into the indicators that are used to monitor the health service performance. Health Information System To be able to monitor progress towards achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC) targets, the country\u2019s health information system needs to draw upon multiple data sources such as population-based surveys, civil registration, and vital statistics. Other sources may include, census, public health surveillance, health facility and community systems data which may be derived from administrative and non-health sector data sources. The WHO SCORE assessment tool1 provides the framework around which the health information system for Ghana can be looked at. 1 Score to reach your Health Goals: A technical package to strengthen country health data for Universal Health Coverage and Health related SDGs.

There are multiple health data platforms in the health sector. However, these platforms have limited interoperability features. Health Service Data Routine health care data in Ghana is collected, collated, and analysed epidemiologically. The current practice is that all health facilities both private and public report on all services provided according to the agreed summarized format for reporting on specific services, programmes, and projects as shown in figure 2. The District Health Information Management System (DHIMS2) platform is a web-based system that is used to facilitate the management of health care data from the districts. Facilities are to report through the Districts/Municipals/Sub-Metropolitan/Metropolitan Health Directorates in which they are located. The challenge with this arrangement has been the difficulty in getting the Teaching Hospitals, Quasi-government facilities and some private hospitals to align to this epidemiological (person, place, and time) reporting as they do not see their facilities as being part of the district health system. This leads to incompleteness in service delivery reports in districts with these facilities thereby affecting health planning and response to critical health events in these districts, municipalities, and metropolises.

Source: NMCP Monitoring and Evaluation plan Public and private facilities use either manual or electronic means to register and document the services that they offer to clients. There is an increasing use of electronic Medical Records by facilities to manage patients\u2019 health care data. For all facilities aligning to the epidemiological approach to reporting on health care data collected either from electronic medical records or from manual registers, data are summarized, verified, and signed off by in-charges. Most facilities validate their data before entering into DHIMS2. However, facilities without capacity and access to computers and/or internet submit their data manually to the sub-district for verification and data entry into the DHIMS2. Districts collate quarterly activity reports of sub- districts/facilities and submit to regions. Regions collate quarterly activity reports from districts and submit to National level. The Human Resource Information System (HRIS) This system is managed by the Human Resource Division of the Ghana Health Service. It is used to input individual employee\u2019s data to facilitate promotions, transfers, and other human resource functions. An e-portal for recruitment has been deployed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to ensure transparency and equity in the distribution of new staff. In addition, there exist, a workforce information management system for Ghana. The Public Service Commission also maintains an electronic platform of health workers that facilitate human resource management in the public sector. The Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) The Ghana integrated Logistics Management Information System (GhILMIS) is designed to collect, record, and report critical supply chain data. Consequently, it provides decision- makers throughout the supply chain with accurate, timely, and appropriate data that include quantities, time, condition, and cost. National Health Insurance Information Systems The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) was established by an act of"}

The NHIA also manages the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). By these mandates, the Authority generates membership data for both subscribers and service providers. It also manages claims data generated by service providers. These data provide useful indicators for tracking performance of the schemes and supporting decision making in the health sector. Regulatory Agencies Information Systems Several regulatory agencies in the country also produce and maintain population-based data in health sector. They regulate health professionals, food and drugs, health service delivery environment and health insurance industry. The regulatory agencies generate data on both public and private health facilities in the country through execution of their mandates. 12 Civil Registration and Vital Statistics The Births and Deaths Registry was established by Act 301 of 1965, within the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development to develop and manage the births and death registration system in Ghana. Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1027 of 2020 defines the functions of the Births and Deaths Registry. Its core business is to provide accurate and reliable information on all births and deaths occurring within Ghana for socio-economic development of the country through their registration and certification. The Health Sector through the health facilities in the districts collaborate with the Births and Deaths Registry to ensure that all births and deaths occurring in health facilities are registered. Data on registration of births that occurs within health facilities are shared with the district offices of Births and Deaths Registry where these births occurred. Registration of deaths that occur within a health facility are initiated by doctors providing the relatives of the decease with medical certificate of cause of death"}

Population and Housing Census The Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) by the Statistical Service Act, 2019 (Act 1003) is the central statistics producing and coordinating institution for the National Statistical System. Their role is to strengthen the production of quality, relevant, accurate and timely statistical information for the purpose of national development2. The Ghana Statistical Service is responsible for conducting the Population and Housing Census that is organized every ten years, the results of the Census and its projections over the intercensal years provide data for generating population-based health indicators. Population-based Surveys The GSS in collaboration with the Ministry of Health supported by Measure Evaluation conducts community-based surveys like the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) every five years and with support from UNICEF, conducts the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) every three years. These two surveys generate key population-based maternal, child health, nutrition, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases indicators that facilitate decision-making in the health sector. The GSS engages the Health Sector when developing the tools that are used in these surveys. There are other population-based surveys conducted by the Ghana Statistical Services like the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS), Maternal Health Survey (MHS) and Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) that also provide some useful health indicators for monitoring and evaluating the health sector.

Tracer medicines availability surveys are also conducted by Facilities Drug and Therapeutic Committees and reported in the DHIMS2; however, data completeness needs to be improved. Health Sector Data Governance Structure The MOH is responsible for coordinating and reporting on health data in Ghana. It depends on its agencies to facilitate the collection and collation of these data. Currently, the organizational unit responsible for managing health care data in the Health Sector is the Centre for Health Information Management (CHIM), which is currently a Unit under the Information Monitoring and Evaluation (IME) Department of the Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME) Division of the Ghana Health Service (GHS). The head of CHIM reports to the Deputy Director of the IME department who in turn reports to the Director of PPME of GHS. The Director, PPME of GHS reports to the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service. The CHIM was created by the MOH and was under the Research, Statistics, and Information Management (RSIM) Directorate, to manage health data for the Ministry. With the Health Reforms and the passage of Act 525 that led to the creation of service implementing agencies of the Ministry of Health, CHIM was placed under GHS. The CHIM\u2019s mandate in managing the health sector data was, however, not changed. The arrangement as it currently stands has created some governance challenges that have affected completeness of health service data reporting by the other service agencies of the MOH"}

In case a partner organisation requires data, a request is made to the Director-General of the GHS who then authorizes the Director of PPME DIRECTORATE to facilitate the provision of the data. The data is provided by CHIM staff in an electronic format. Regarding the system governance, there are quarterly, half-yearly and annual reviews which uses data generated from DHIMS2. On a yearly basis, national requirements and data needs are revised and changes made accordingly in the national DHIMS2 configuration. The Ministry of Health has not established formal links to sources of information outside the health sector. There are regular and irregular communications between MOH, GHS, donors, academia and GSS. There is also no inter-agency coordinating mechanism for health information. To provide the needed oversight and engender a sense of ownership of data in the health sector, the Information Monitoring and Evaluation (IME) technical working group with membership from selected service agencies have been formed and tasked with providing 14 technical oversight for CHIM.

Despite these arrangements, there are still resistance from some agencies in adhering to the epidemiological reporting arrangement through CHIM. National Health Information System Assessment The most recent assessment of the National Health Information system is the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) SCORE assessment conducted in 2019. The assessment covers five components of the Health Information System, and these are: \u2022 S-Surveys, \u2022 C-Counts of Births and Deaths, \u2022 O-Optimizing health service data, \u2022 R-Review progress and performance, \u2022 E-Enable data use for policy and action. The tool used for the score assessment consists of a technical package of five essential interventions as indicated above. The key elements are meant to assess and strengthen country health data and information systems to enable governments to track progress towards the health-related SDGs and national and subnational priorities. The assessment shows that Ghana\u2019s Health Information System had sixty-six percent of key indicators needed to assess the achievement of the SDGs in the National Health Information System. On the five key SCORE assessment, Ghana was assessed as having a well-developed capacity with regards to 15 surveys with the only weakness being the lack of data on facility surveys. It had limited capacity with regards to counts of birth, deaths, and the causes of deaths. With regards to optimizing health service data the National Health Information was assessed as having moderate capacity. On systems for reviewing progress and performance it was assessed as having sustainable capacity. Finally, it was assessed as having a well-developed"}

As revealed by the SWOT analysis above, lack of uniform standards for health information practices has resulted in uncontrolled proliferation and duplication of software systems. The absence of sector-specific interoperability standards has also resulted in limited interoperability between diverse agency electronic systems, leading to very little information sharing among agencies; thus, negatively affecting informed decision-making. The need for private sector contribution to data and data management in the health sector cannot be overemphasised. Furthermore, the resources necessary for information management in the health sector (skilled human resource, finance, technical and physical infrastructure, laws, and policies etc.) have not evolved in parallel to cope with increased demand for data management, information dissemination and use in the health sector. The development of this strategic plan is to provide the framework and plan to address some of these identified weaknesses in the Health Information System of Ghana. 1.3 Purpose of strategic plan The purpose of this health information system strategic plan is to provide directions for Health Information Management in the health sector.

The Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Plan serves as a framework to guide and support the vital roles of nurses and midwives in delivering exceptional healthcare services. This comprehensive strategic plan developed collaboratively with input from stakeholders across the nursing and midwifery professions, emphasises the importance of employment, education, leadership, research/innovations, service delivery, data governance, partnerships and professional development to meet the evolving needs of our patients. The Strategic Plan encapsulates the collective vision, goals, and actions required to address these challenges and capitalise on the opportunities that lie ahead. This plan aims to empower nurses and midwives by providing a clear roadmap for their professional growth and development. It outlines strategies that promote interdisciplinary collaboration, leadership, and evidence-based practice, enabling our nursing and midwifery workforce to thrive in their roles. By investing in these strategies, we reaffirm our commitment to providing safe, efficient, and high-quality healthcare that meets the unique needs of every patient. viii ix The Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Plan and Services Framework for 2024-2028 is a comprehensive plan initiated by the Nursing and Midwifery Office of the Ministry of Health with funding support from UNFPA with extensive input from stakeholders across nursing and midwifery professions. It is the third plan in succession and aligned with the Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan, the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Roadmap for Ghana, the Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery, 2021-2025.

The process of development of the plan was extensive with a Technical Working Group (TWG) constituted by the MoH which started working from July until September 2023. The TWG members were drawn from Policy, Academia, Regulation, Practice, Associations and Partners. All agencies of the MoH in relation to Nursing and Midwifery were duly represented on the TWG. Three different levels of meetings were conducted. The process started with an implementation update meeting of all agencies for the old plan. The aim was to have agencies provide the status of implementation for the year five of the 2019-2023 plan. This was followed by the first TWG meeting to review the implementation of the old strategic plan and services framework. The process and approach for the evaluation process and tools for field reports were discussed and validated at this meeting. The second TWG meeting reviewed findings of the field report and then reprioritised for the next plan. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY x The meeting did further situational analysis coupled with findings of the finding of the field visits, which culminated into the prioritisation for the next five-year plan. The plan, which has seven strategic objectives and several key interventions, focuses on Jobs, Education, Leadership, Research/Innovations, Service Delivery, Data Governance Partnerships and Collaboration, for professional development to meet the evolving needs of patients. It also prioritises patient well-being by providing compassionate and respectful care and aims at delivering high-quality and safe healthcare services while fostering a culture of innovation and evidence-based practices. Teamwork and ethical behaviour among healthcare professionals are also prioritised to ensure the best possible patient outcomes. The structure of this strategic plan is arranged in five chapters.

They are on the front lines of healthcare delivery, providing essential care to individuals, families, and communities.

Nurses and midwives can provide a wide range of preventive and curative services, including health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Moreover, nurses and midwives are crucial in improving access to maternal and child healthcare. Midwives, in particular, have specialized knowledge and skills in managing pregnancy, childbirth, and the immediate postnatal period. Nurses and midwives play a vital role in ensuring safe deliveries and reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. Additionally, midwives provide essential prenatal and postnatal care, monitoring the health of the mother and child and offering guidance and support. Nurses also have a significant impact on the management of chronic conditions and non-communicable diseases. With their expertise in monitoring vital signs, administering medications, and providing education, counselling and providing specialized care, they play a vital role in preventing complications and improving outcomes for patients with chronic illnesses. They also promote self-management and empower patients to take control of their health. 2 In addition to their direct patient care responsibilities, nurses and midwives are invaluable in strengthening health systems. They contribute to health system resilience by working collaboratively with other healthcare professionals, such as doctors, pharmacists, and community health workers. They provide leadership and expert guidance in healthcare planning, policy development, and quality improvement initiatives. Furthermore, nurses and midwives are essential in addressing health disparities and reducing inequities. They have a unique understanding of the communities they serve and are often trusted sources of healthcare information. They can advocate for vulnerable populations and ensure that services are tailored to meet their specific needs. Overall, nurses and midwives are integral to achieving universal coverage of healthcare services. Their expertise, compassion, and tireless efforts are essential in delivering quality healthcare to all"}

Investing in nurses and midwives is not only crucial for achieving universal health coverage but also for strengthening health systems and improving health outcomes for all. It is in light of the above that the MoH places premium on nursing systems, structures and processes to improve the health care delivery system in Ghana knowing that they form about 60% of the health workforce. The second strategic plan, which was developed in 2019, aimed to build on the successes of the first strategic plan to inspire and align with the vision, mission, and goals of the MOH, GHS, and health sector, as well as the medium-term development plan, UHC, and SDGs and the WHO global Strategic Direction for Nursing and Midwifery. 3 To guarantee a healthy population for national development, the strategic plan's aim was to offer sustainable, high-quality nursing and midwifery services that are available, comprehensible and implementable. To achieve UHC in Ghana, the 2019-2023 strategic plan set out to reposition the nursing and midwifery systems as a driving force. The goal was to contribute to the achievement of UHC and SDGs through the provision of quality and equitable nursing and midwifery services to the general population with a special focus on reproductive maternal newborn, child, and adolescent health. Stakeholders identified key issues in areas such as Education and Research, Organization of Services and Package of Care, Regulation and Practice, Leadership and Governance, Nursing and Midwifery Workforce affecting nursing and midwifery practice in Ghana. This strategic thematic area emerged because of the major concerns facing nursing and midwifery and the strategic implementation efforts at the time but was ultimately targeted at the vulnerable population.

Some key findings from the evaluation of the old plan with regards to the five thematic areas of Education and Research; Regulation and Practice; Package of Care and Organization of Services; Leadership and Governance and Workforce Strengthening revealed the following: General improvement in governance and leadership interventions for nursing and midwifery practice such as Institutionalization of the Annual 4 Nursing and Midwifery Leaders and Managers Conference; Institutionalization of the Annual National Nursing and Midwifery Excellence and Hall of Fame Awards; Improvement in infrastructure at the Health Training Institutions; Improvement in the scope and quality of Nursing and midwifery training and practice such as Strengthening of preceptorship system with a total of 518 benefiting from training in the last five years from facilities visited during the field assessment, increased production of nurses and midwives from the training schools , the introduction of 13 new specialist programs by GCNM with over 2022 graduands at associates and membership levels and a general improvement in regulation and supervision. The plan however suffered from low implementation due to low awareness at all levels. The TWG did a situational analysis in a number areas including the 2020 WHO/ICN/ICM Global Strategic Direction for Nursing and Midwifery (SDNM) which serves as the framework for all Member States of WHO to align country strategic plans.

A situational analysis, considering both the internal and external factors, provides a comprehensive view of the current state of these systems. This chapter describes key areas that are relevant to nursing and midwifery in the overall achievement of health outcomes in line with the strategic directions of the plan. 2.1 Workforce and Jobs The nursing and midwifery workforce has grown in the last five years with about 67% being employed by the public sector alone. It is estimated that, the total nursing and midwifery population as at 2022 is about 218,000(MoH-N&MC, 2022). The population of midwives has seen significant increase in the last five years due to the establishment of midwifery schools at both direct entry level and post-basic levels. These numbers have also contributed to a significant improvement of the nurse-patient ratio in the last five years. For instance, the Nurse to population ratio in 2018 was 1.20. This increased to 1.99 in 2022, higher than the WHO threshold of 1 to a 1000 Population (MoH Holistic Assessment Report, 2022) indicating that the country has excess nurses although the issue of inequitable distribution still remains. Most nurses do not accept posting to rural areas due to poor social amenities including schools, water, accommodation, communication, security and road networks. The situation has affected access to professional nurses and midwifery services in rural communities. However, in the last three years, government is unable to give financial clearance to nurses and midwives and the entire health workers as a whole due to current economic challenges. As a result of this, there is a back log of over 60,000 nurses and midwives who are unemployed. 9"}

Annually, an average of 30,000 nurses and midwives graduate from diploma, degree and certificate levels programmes. This phenomenon may be due to the ever increasing number of senior high school graduates occurring as a result of the free senior high school policy. There are growing opportunities for the youth to gain admission into the nursing and midwifery training schools. As part of the processes to improve nursing and midwifery education, the MoH with collaboration and funding support from UNFPA have streamlined the preceptorship system to ensure quality training. The field visits revealed that for the institutions visited, Over 518 preceptors have been trained across the country since 2019 w h e r e s o m e w e r e u n d e r t h e funding support of UNFPA and others were funded by the institutions themselves. Out of the preceptorship training, 25 nurses and midwives have also been trained as National Resource persons to support the training of preceptors. Unfortunately, the tutor to student ratio is still very low and as a result, affects the quality training of students. Over the last five years, there has been increased enrolment and induction of nurse/midwife specialists coupled with introduction of 13 new programmes by the Ghana College of Nurses and Midwives. There is therefore the need for ongoing professional development and upskilling to improve the overall competency of the workforce. There is the need to further invest in specialisation of nurses and midwives in order to meet the demands of the population. 10 2.3 Migration The migration of nurses and midwives from"}

The country has experienced a large outflow of these health professionals, leading to critical shortages in the healthcare workforce and negative impacts on the health system. One of the main reasons for this migration is the sub-optimal working conditions and limited opportunities for career advancement in Ghana. Many nurses and midwives seek better pay, improved working conditions, and professional growth in other countries, particularly in developed nations such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Another factor contributing to the migration is the limited availability of resources in the Ghanaian healthcare system. Insufficient medical equipment, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of essential supplies put a strain on healthcare workers and impede their ability to provide quality care. This, coupled with the heavy workload, often pushes nurses and midwives to seek opportunities elsewhere. The consequences of this migration are severe for Ghana's healthcare system. The country faces significant gaps in healthcare delivery, leading to increased patient loads and the deterioration of service quality. The situation is especially dire in rural areas where shortages are more pronounced, making it difficult for individuals to access essential healthcare services. To mitigate this issue, the Ghanaian government has taken several measures. Efforts have been made to improve working conditions, increase salaries, and provide opportunities for professional development. Furthermore, stricter regulations and policies have been implemented to curb illegal recruitment and encourage professionals to stay in the country. 11 Efforts have also been made to increase the number of nursing and midwifery training institutions to meet the demand for healthcare professionals. The hope is that by offering more training opportunities, the healthcare system can retain more nurses and midwives. However, despite these efforts, the migration of nurses and midwives from Ghana remains a complex"}

Further investment in the healthcare system and the implementation of long-term strategies to improve working conditions and incentive packages are essential to address the root causes of migration and retain these valuable healthcare professionals. 2.4 Work Environment Nurses and midwives often work in challenging conditions, including inadequate facilities, limited resources, and high patient volumes. This negatively impacts job satisfaction and the quality of care provided. Nurses and midwives often face poor working conditions, including long hours, inadequate remuneration, and a lack of supportive supervision. These factors contribute to job dissatisfaction and can lead to healthcare workers seeking employment opportunities abroad. 2.5 Demographic Changes Ghana's population is growing rapidly, and the healthcare needs of the population are evolving. The aging population and the increase in non-communicable diseases pose new challenges that require specialized nursing and midwifery services in the country. 12 2.6 Health Infrastructure The availability and quality of healthcare facilities and services vary across different regions of Ghana. Rural areas often lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, making it difficult for nurses and midwives to provide quality care. Some nurses and midwives posted to such rural places had to work in deplorable health facilities that are very dangerous to their health and safety. The conditions of these health facilities do not meet the standards expected of a healthcare facility, yet nurses and midwives are required to work in such locations. The Government of Ghana over the last decade has however invested hugely in health care infrastructure across the country with state-of-the-art standards. The infrastructure development ranges from construction of new district and regional hospitals, polyclinics, health centres and CHPS compounds. Some of the clinical structures are accompanied with non-clinical structures such as accommodation for nurses and midwives. The accommodations are however not adequate to meet the number"}

Ensuring alignment between policies, regulations, practice and the needs of the population is essential. The compliance to professional regulation and practice is very crucial to safeguard the quality of life of the population. In recent times, there has been increased medico-legal cases involving both public and private institutions. The N&MC for instance has sanctioned about 5 nurses and midwives in the private sector in the last five years. These trends if allowed to fester will create disaffection of the population to nurses and midwives. It is therefore important to adopt high level quality improvement and best practices in nursing and midwifery care. 13 2.8 Service Delivery Service delivery is pivotal in any outcome of a healthcare organization. Currently, healthcare service delivery in Ghana varies significantly across the regions. Different cadres of Nursing and Midwifery health professionals are also available in providing care and support for clients. The national implementation of NHIS is promoting access to health care services across all levels of care. The health system has a structured referral system for continuity of care across the levels but with poor coordination mainly between the levels. The existence of regulatory bodies for regulating healthcare institutions are a strong base for ensuring adherence to standards of care and professional practice, although regulatory monitoring is not as effective as expected. The finalization of the essential package of health services for all the levels of care is good intervention to support nursing and midwifery services. The Nursing and Midwifery Council's redefinition of the scope of practice for all cadres of nurses and midwives is a positive development. This will help in reducing ambiguities in the practice"}

There are still a number of challenges affecting service delivery particularly at the Primary Health Care level. All the health facility capacity assessments conducted indicate severe shortages in basic supplies, medicines and equipment. The CHPS verification exercise conducted in 2018 revealed that only about a third of CHPS were considered to have basic equipment. The 2020 EMoNC survey showed that the proportion of facilities able to provide BEMoNC was low and declining; and there were persistent stock-outs of supplies and medicines. Sexual, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and Nutrition services are very critical to the achievement of UHC in Ghana. 14 Well empowered midwives and other nurses have a key role in improving the existing indicators. Maternal Mortality rate of 310 per 100,000 live births (MHS, 2017) still remains high; the availability of skilled birth attendants is still limited though skilled delivery has improved from 76% in 2014 to 88% in 2022.Under 5 mortality has also improved from 60 per 1000 live births in 2014 to 40 per 1000 live births in 2022 (GDHS, 2022). However, there remain serious challenges especially in rural areas when it comes to access to such services. This may hamper efforts to reduce maternal and child deaths and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It is therefore very relevant for nurses and midwives to work more closely together and chat the pathway for the health sector. 2.9 Implementation of Network of Practice (NoP) Ghana has opted to use a \u2018Hub and Spokes \u2019 model for the design of the NoPs because it aligns most closely with its district health structure. This new care model has significant implications for nursing and midwifery services at the primary healthcare level, as the Networks of Practice will provide comprehensive, patient-centred networks that deliver equitably distributed,"}

This strategic plan duly recognises the NoP as a vital and an integral part of the service delivery architecture and part of nursing and midwifery practice. 15 2.1.0 Data Governance Data governance in nursing and midwifery ultimately aims to promote the effective and ethical use of healthcare data, ensuring that it is accurate, secure, and accessible for quality patient care and research purposes. There are several contemporary issues of data governance in nursing and midwifery practice that are relevant today. These include: Privacy and confidentiality: With the increasing digitization of patient health records and the use of electronic health systems, ensuring privacy and confidentiality of patient data has become a significant issue. Healthcare organizations need to implement robust data governance policies and procedures to protect patient information from unauthorized access and breaches. Data quality and integrity: Maintaining the accuracy and integrity of data is crucial for effective healthcare decision- making. However, issues related to data entry errors, incomplete documentation, and inconsistent data standards can compromise the quality of healthcare data. Data governance practices should focus on ensuring data accuracy, validity, and completeness. Interoperability and data sharing: Nursing and midwifery practice involves collaboration and communication among various healthcare providers and organizations. However, different electronic health record systems and incompatible data standards can hinder effective data sharing and exchange. Data governance efforts should address interoperability challenges to enable seamless sharing of patient information across different healthcare settings. Ethical considerations: The collection and use of health data raise ethical concerns, especially related to informed consent, data ownership, and potential misuse of sensitive information. 16 Data governance strategies should incorporate ethical frameworks, guidelines, and policies to ensure the ethical use of"}

Security and cyber-security: As healthcare systems become increasingly dependent on technology, the risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks also increases. Protecting patient data from unauthorized access, hacking, and ransomware attacks requires robust cybersecurity measures and strong data governance practices. Data analytics and decision support: Utilizing data analytics and decision support tools can enhance nursing and midwifery practice by providing evidence-based insights for clinical decision-making. However, challenges related to data analytics infrastructure, data analytics skills of practitioners, and interpretability of analytics results need to be addressed through effective data governance practices. Overall, contemporary issues of data governance in nursing and midwifery practice revolve around privacy, data quality, interoperability, ethics, security, and leveraging data analytics for improved patient outcomes. Developing comprehensive data governance frameworks is essential to address these issues and ensure the effective and responsible use of data in healthcare. 2.1.1 Opportunities The following opportunities have been identified to support the achievement of the plan Collaboration and Partnerships Strengthening collaboration among different stakeholders, such as the government, healthcare organizations, the private sector and academic institutions, can lead to improved training, resource allocation, and service delivery. 17 Partnerships with international organizations can also provide opportunities for knowledge exchange and capacity building. Technology and Innovation There are inadequate health facilities in terms of infrastructure and equipment availability. In addition, available facilities and equipment are often inefficiently and sub-optimally utilized. Digital health technologies have become an essential resource in primary care, and with the emergence of COVID- 19, health systems are seeing rapid integration of technology such as telemedicine that supports primary care and essential public health functions in many ways. The adoption of digital health technologies, telehealth services, and electronic health records can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of nursing and midwifery services. Utilizing mobile health"}

The MoH has already rolled out the national agenda to digitize all institutions under the e-health project in line with the government digitization agenda. Community Engagement and Empowerment Involving and educating the community about the role of nurses and midwives can increase awareness of the services available and promote trust in the healthcare system. Empowering communities to take an active role in their healthcare can improve health outcomes and relieve some of the burden on healthcare professionals. Overall, the situational analysis highlights the need for addressing workforce challenges, improving education and training programs, and enhancing the healthcare infrastructure in Ghana. By leveraging opportunities for collaboration, technology adoption, and community engagement, nursing and midwifery services can be strengthened to meet the evolving healthcare needs of the population 18 CHAPTER 3 STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS AND INTERVENTIONS The following Seven Strategic Directions have been agreed upon for the implementation of the next strategic plan: \u27a2 EDUCATION \u27a2 JOBS \u27a2 LEADERSHIP \u27a2 SERVICE DELIVERY \u27a2 DATA GOVERNANCE \u27a2 RESEARCH AND INNOVATIONS \u27a2 PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION 3.1 Strategic Objectives and Interventions Strategic Objective 1: Education Ensure high quality nursing and midwifery education in line with global standards.

National Health Insurance Policy Page 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In line with the GhanaPovertyReductionStrategy(GPRS)the governmenthas initiated a policy to deliver accessible, affordable, and good quality health care to all Ghanaiansespeciallythe poor and most vulnerablein society. The current out-of-pocket payment for health care at the point of service delivery popularly known as \"Cash and Carry\" poses a financial barrier to I healthcareaccess. Indeedit is estimatedthatout of eighteenpercentof the I population who require health care at any given time, only twenty percent of them are able to access it. That is about eighty percent of people living in Ghana who need health care cannot afford topay out-of-pocket at the point of service use. This has resulted in delays in seeking health care, non- compliancetotreatment, andconsequently premature death. To address the problem of financial barrier to health care access, the government in 2001 has initiated a National Health Insurance Scheme as a humane approachtofinancing health care. The aim of the health insurance scheme in Ghana is to enable the government achieve its set health goal within the context of the GPRS and the Health SectorFiveYearProgramme ofWork,2002-2006. Ultimately, the vision of government in instituting a health insurance scheme in the country is to assure equitable and universal access for all residents of Ghana to an acceptable quality package of essential health care. The policy objective"}

J\" Page 2 National Health Insurance Policy Hence the two main types of health insurance regimes shall be operational in Ghana. These are the Social-type Health Insurance Scheme made up of District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme and the. Private Mutual Health Insurance Schemes andthe Private Commercial HealthInsurance Schemes. rt The government has electedto support the development ofthe District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme (DMHIS) to serve as a strategy for delivering its pro-poor policy to the underprivileged segments of the society. The District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme is therefore, a fusion of the two concepts; the traditional Social Health Insurance Scheme for the formal sector workers and the traditional Mutual Health Insurance organisations for the informal sector ofthe society. Thus, DMHISs will incorporate members from both the formal and informal sectors. All the types of insurance models shall have governingboards tobring aboutbestmanagement practices, good governance and democracy. It is compulsory for every person living in Ghana to belong to a health insurance scheme type. This is in the light of the spirit of solidarity, social responsibili~y,equity, and a sense of belongingness in the building of a healthy and prosperous nation. Every person living in Ghana shall contribute according to the principle of ability to pay in order to enjoy a package ofhealth servicescovering over 95% of"}

The formal sector shall contribute 2.5% of their 17.5% Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) contribution whereas the informal sector shall contribute at least ~72,OOOper annum. The contribution levels have an inbuilt cross-subsidization mechanism whereby the rich pay more than the less privileged, adults pay on behalf of children, the healthy cover for the sick . andurban dwellerspay morethan therural dwellers. Contribution levels of the people shall be categorised based on their socio- economic stratification. Thepolicy proposes six main types of categorization as: core poor, verypoor, poor;middle income,rich, andvery rich. All of these shall pay inlinewiththeir abilitytopay. . Nationai Health Insurance Policy Page 3 The policy adopts a minimum benefit package as defined by the rules and regulations contained in the legislative instrument, which is described exhaustively atthe appendix ofthis document. The objectives of the minimum benefit package are; to ensure that every citizen of this country has access to a level of healthcare that provides adequate security against diseases and injury, and to promote and maintain good health. Secondly to secure the financial sustainability of the schemes. through protectionfrom excess costburden. All service providers within the public, private and mission sectors shall be mobilised into providing this benefit package. However, they will have to satisfy anaccreditation criteria.

The method of financing healthcare determines its accessibility and affordability. Currently, the \"Cash and Carry\" system of partly financing the public sector healthcare delivery poses a financial barrier in particular to the poor. As a poverty reduction strategy, Government has taken steps to put in place the framework for the establishment of health insurance in the country. The policy framework allows for the establishment of multiple health insJ.lrance schemes with a focus on the social-type known as District Mutual health Insurance to addresstheneeds ofthe poor. Financing health care has gone through a chequered history in Ghana. Immediately after independence health care provided to the people was \"free\" in public health facilities. This meant that there was no direct out-of- pocket payment at the point of consumption of health care in public health facilities. Financing"}

The sustainability of this form of financing became questionable as the economy began to show signs of decline and there were competing demands on the same source. What is important to note was that the general tax revenue did not allow for a percentage earmarked for health as we now have in the case of a percentage of VAT funds earmarked for education. This situation continued until 1985 when the Government introduced the user fees for all medical conditions except certain specified communicable diseases. The free health care policy was badly implemented in that although communicable diseases were supposed to have been exempted, in practice nobody enjoyed this facility. Also, a guideline for implementation was not provided and no conscious system was designed to prevent possible financial leakages. In the ensuing years the standard of health care provision fell drastically. There was acute shortage of essential drugs in all public health facilities. Most importantly, the introduction of the user fees resulted in the first observed decline in utilization of health services in the country. IGhana Living Standard Survey, 2000 - National Health Insurance Policy Page 5 In spite of this, the government went ahead to institute full cost recovery for drugs as a way of generating revenue to address the shortage of drugs. The payment mechanism put in place was termed \"Cash and Carry\". The implementation ofthe \"Cash and Carry\" compounded the utilization problem by creating a financialbarrier to health careaccess especially for the poor.It is estimated that out ofthe eighteen percent ofthe population who require health care at any given time, only twenty percent of them are able to access it. Implying that about eighty percent of Ghanaianswho need health care cannot afford it. The Government noting"}

The implementation of the programme to replace the \"Cash and Carry--\"would be in phases. This approach takes cognizance of the fact that uptake of health insurance is dependent on various factors including revel of confidence, perceived quality of care, willingness of individuals to subscribe to it and the attractiveness of the benefit package. Thus, the implementation ofthe health insurancewould be a gradualprocess. Context ofHealth Insurance I I. Healthcare financing may be done through a number of options either singularly or a combination. These options may be classified broadly into the following; i. Directout-of-pocketpayment atthepoint of service andpersonal health account, ii. Riskpoolingor sharingthrough taxrevenue and health insurance. Thus, Health Insurance is one of several methods that the government is adopting to finance health care in the country. Currently, 80% of health financing in the public health sector is through tax revenue and donor funds. The 20% is from internally generated funds through the \"Cash and Carry\" System. As indicated earlier, health Insurance is to replace the \"Cash and Carry\" system of payment of health services consumed. This means that tax revenue would continue to form part of the overall health sector financing strategy for a long time to come. It is note worthy that health insurance does not abolish cost recovery but it does replace direct out-of-pockets payment at thepoint ofserviceuse. The aim of the health insurance is to enable the government achieve its set health goal within the context of the GPRS and the health sector's Five-Year Programme of Work, 2002 -2006 . II!.

Nonetheless, access is a function of location of providers of services, cost of - care and ability to pay, quality of care and socio-cultural aspects of service provision, Financial barrier to health care is dependent on the payment mechanism that is put in place at the time of use of service. Out of pocket payment at the time of use reinforces non-access to health care. Prepayment schemes minimize or remove the financial barrier to accessing health care. That is accesstohealth care becomes independent ofthe individuals abilityto paY\"out of pocket at the time of illness. Direct out of pocket payment is regressive inthat ahigher proportion of income ofthe poor and lower income groups go into health care, Moreover,people are expected to pay for services consumed at the time of illness when in fact they are actually non-productive duringtheperiod, Fig 1.

This way,everyone will be protected from the problems that are associated with having to find money atthetime of illness beforeneeded services can beprovided. The Goal Health Insurance will replace out ofpocketpayments byproviding a specified minimum healthcare benefit packageat thepoint of serviceuse. Policy Objective Within the next five years, every resident of Ghana shall belong to a health insurance scheme that adequately covers him or her against the need to pay out-of-pocket at point of service use in order to obtain access to a defined package of acceptable qualityhealth services. Specifically,within the next five years, the necessary bodies will be created, awareness raising and consensus building will be carried out, the needed legislation passed and the enabling environment developed to ensure the realizationof thepolicy goal ofgovernment. Principles underlying the Design I I. As indicated earlier, about 70% of Ghanaians are in the non-formal sector of the economy. There are two main problems with this sector. The first is the difficulty that may be encountered in collecting contributions. This means that traditional mechanisms for organising communal contributions need to be examined and factored into the design of the schemes. The second problem, which is a critical one, is that most people, at least 40%, live below"}

Page 8 National Health Insurance Policy Thus, the design would take into account the following principles; . Equity Risk equalization Cross-subsidization Solidarity Quality care Efficiency inpremium collection and claimsadministration Communityor subscriber ownership Partnership Reinsurance Sustainability . . .. . . ... Equity implies that everybody has access to the minimum benefit package irrespective of peoples' socio-economic background. This means that everybody should have the opportunity tojoin a health insurance scheme. So health insurance should be at the door-step of every resident in Ghana.Also, health insurance should be available all the time so that subscribers are not denied accessto health carewhen they n~edit. Risk-equalisation: The scheme should ensure that disease burden and mortality patterns serve as one of the basis for allocating financial resources to geographical areas of the country.The cost of care varies depending on the disease burden in the geographical areas. Moreover, disease burden correlates positively with poverty. Thus, the higher the poverty level the heavier the disease burden. A formula for risk-equalistion shall be developed to make upthe costdifferencebased on theminimum contribution levels. Cross-subsidisation: The design of the scheme should. be such that contdimtion is based onability topay.Inthis casethe rich willpay morewhile the poor pay less. Also, it must ensurethat all persons contribute and not only have thosewith therisk of falling illjoin the scheme. Thus, therich willcross- subsidise the poor and vulnerable, the healthy will cross-subsidise the sick and the economicallyactive adultswill cross-subsidise the children. 3 Ghana Living Standard Survey II:..- National Health Insurance"}

When clientsperceive health services used as value for the money their propensity to utilize health care increases. Perceived quality of care is also linked to health careaccess aspoor quality of care is a barrier to access. Thus,when everything remains constant, people are more likely to use health care that they perceive tobe goodthan oneperceived to be bad. . Solidarity is a desired virtue in social health insurance. The purpose of health insurance in Ghana is to remove financial barrier to health care access which ultimately will impact on the health status of the population. It is important to note that our individual health status are interlinked especially when dealing with communicable diseases which are the main causes of morbidity in this country.To be free of such diseases one has to help his or her neighbour who happens to have been affiictedwith a communicable disease in order to getrid of these diseases in most cases. The vulnerable groups are the poor, children and the elderly.These groups need the support of the rest ofthe population in terms ofhealth careaccess. Efficien~y in the collection of contributions and claims administration: there are two issues relating to efficiency; the demand or purchasing side efficiency and supply side efficiency. In the case of the former, collection of contributions is vital for building a sustainable fund for the social-type health insurance schemes in the country. The problem in our circumstance is that most of the potential contributors are in the informal sector of the economy where formal systems of collection of contributions do not exist. Consequently, the NHIS shall adopt existing informal traditional systems of . community contributions. In the case of the latter, the issue is about how fast the"}

In 2006, the Ministry of Health developed the health care waste policy and guidelines. This guidance document improved health care waste management in the country. With support from the UNDP-GEF medical waste management project, the Ministry of Health has revised the existing National Health Care Waste Management (HCWM), policy and guideline, 2006 and has produced two separate documents- A National Health Care Waste Management Policy and a National Guideline for Health Care Waste Management countrywide. This policy is replacing the 2006 policy and introduces new technical and administrative policy issues to enhance waste management in health care facilities. Institutional arrangements for the implementation of the policy has been addressed to explain the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders to ensure that there are concerted efforts towards improving the current health care waste management situation. The need for training and the monitoring of the HCWM system have been outlined for management at the facilities to enhance common knowledge of safe HCWM and to evaluate their management practices during the implementation of the waste management systems. The importance of ensuring the availability of financial resources to make the system functional cannot be overemphasized. It is hoped that all facility managers will include waste management in their list of priorities and consequently make necessary budgetary allocations towards capacity building of its staff and securing the tools necessary for efficient waste management on an on-going basis. This policy document is the outcome of a collaborative effort between the"}

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Nature of Health Care Waste The provision of health care, like any other human activity, generates waste which has to be managed and disposed of in a safe manner, in order to minimize risks posed to health workers, clients, community and the environment. Health Care Waste (HCW) includes all solid and liquid waste (both hazardous and non-hazardous) generated whiles performing medical procedures, or during the performance of medical research involving humans and animals. In addition, it includes the waste originating from minor and scattered sources produced during health care delivery at home (e.g. home dialysis, self- administration of insulin, recuperative care). The greater part of waste generated by health institutions are not hazardous and can be managed like household waste. This constitutes about 75 - 90% of all waste generated in health institutions. However, the remaining 10 - 25 % is hazardous and requires special arrangements for management (WHO, 2014). Examples of hazardous health care waste are pathological waste (e.g. tissues and body fluids), pharmaceuticals (expired or unused drugs etc.), sharps (e.g. syringes, disposable scalpels, scalpel blades, etc.), non-sharp infectious waste (swabs, bandages, disposable medical devices, etc.), chemicals (solvents, disinfectants, nano-medical waste etc.) and radioactive (spent sources of radioactive materials etc.),as well as wastewater including effluents from mortuaries. 1.2. Health System Profile The health policy of the government of Ghana seeks to promote easy access to primary health care. Health centres and posts and in recent times, Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds have been established at"}

Other health care facilities are designed to manage more complex cases, which may be beyond the capability of the community level facilities. Classification of health institutions enables management to plan appropriately xii for health care waste generation, storage, transport, treatment and disposal for each level. This classification is based on daily out-patient department (OPD) attendance, daily admissions, average bed occupancy and the severity of ailment or diagnosis. The referral system is based on the classification category of health institutions. 1.3. Situational Analysis Since 2006, a Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) policy and guideline document has been in place to direct the management of health care waste throughout its lifecycle in the health sector. Although this has resulted in some improvements in health care waste management there were still challenges with the implementation of the policy. A survey carried out in 2013 to assess Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) situation in health care facilities in Ghana showed that waste management practices were below acceptable standards and posed risk to staff and communities (UNDP & MoH, 2014). An inventory of dioxins and furans (Unintended Persistent Organic Pollutants [UPOPS]) from health care facilities showed high levels of these pollutants being released into the atmosphere. Though there are no known exposure limits set for these chemicals, in view of the substantial health risks they pose when one is exposed to them, the Stockholm Convention (2001), which Ghana has ratified, aims at reducing their release and exposure to the lowest possible level through the adoption of best available techniques in health care waste management. The survey brought to the fore the need for: i. Revision of the national health care waste management policy, 2006 with emphasis on non- burn techniques ii. Development of"}

Standardization of waste segregation systems iv. Standardization of colour coding and labelling of waste bins v. Provision of appropriate vehicles for transporting waste; vi. Secured storage sites within the health care facilities vii. Secured environmentally friendly waste disposal sites viii. Sufficient Monitoring / Training / Maintenance / Financing 13 To address these shortfalls, the Ministry of Health set up a working group made up of all relevant stakeholders, both public and private to review and revise the 2006 health care waste management policy and guidelines. 1.4. Purpose and Justification for Policy Review Improvement in quality of care is a major priority for the health sector. Health Care Waste Management is one of the important parameters in assessing Quality of Care in our facilities. Increasing international and national dimensions of diseases like HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Hepatitis and Zika virus has created the need for the health sector to protect its staff, the public and the environment from adverse impacts of health care waste. The health care waste management policy and guidelines of 2006 does not consider new relevant International Conventions Ghana has signed unto after the policy came into force. The current policy further emphasizes the use of non-incineration technologies for waste treatment in health care facilities and the need to promote the international standards for high temperature incineration (800\u00b0C- 1200\u00baC) instead of the current practice with the De Montfort incinerators in health care facilities. This policy review seeks to improve management of health care waste in accordance with existing international conventions through adoption of Best Available Technology (BAT) and Best Environmental Practices (BEP). 14 2.

Ghana has signed and adopted the SDGs into NMTDP its National Medium Development Policy. These new goals universally apply to all member countries and seek to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, tackle climate change and protect the environment and human health to ensure sustainability while ensuring that no one is left behind. Improving Health Care Waste Management will contribute to meeting Ghana's obligation towards achieving Goal 3 - good health and well-being, Goal 6 - clean water and sanitation, Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, and Goal 13 - climate action 2.1.2. Stockholm Convention The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) is an international treaty to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of POPs. The Convention was adopted on 22 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden and entered into force on 17 May 2004. This environmental treaty aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) from all sectors. The health sector releases POPs by treating waste through incineration at low temperature (De Montfort). Key elements of the convention include the requirement that each party provide financial resources and measures to eliminate the production and use of Intentionally Produced POPs (IPOPs), eliminate Unintentionally Produced POP (UPOPs) where feasible and manage and dispose of POPs waste in an environmentally sound manner (Stockholm Convention, 2001). The Stockholm Convention promotes the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT) and Best Environmental Practices (BEP). 2.1.3. Minamata Convention The Minamata Convention on Mercury is an international treaty to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic releases of mercury and mercury compounds (Minamata Convention, 2013). Parties agreed to 15 control and, where"}

Parties also agreed to stop or reduce the use of mercury in various manufacturing processes by specified dates. Provisions in Article 4 of the Convention are especially relevant to the health sector. The Convention set a phase-out date of 2020 for the manufacture, import and export of mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers. It also requires that measures are taken to phase down the use of dental amalgam. 2.1.4. Basel Convention The Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 and came into force on 5 May, 1992. The thrust of the Convention at the time of its adoption was to combat the \u201ctoxic trade\u201d of hazardous waste from industrialized countries to developing countries at the time. The overarching objective of the Convention is to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes including incinerator ash. The provisions of the Convention center around the following principal aims: \u2022 the reduction of hazardous wastes generation and the promotion of environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal; \u2022 the restriction of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; and \u2022 a regulatory system applying to cases where trans-boundary movements are permissible. 2.1.5. Bamako Convention The Bamako Convention is a treaty of African nations prohibiting the import of any hazardous (including radioactive) wastes and includes clinical wastes from medical care in hospitals, medical centres and clinics. The Convention was negotiated by twelve nations of the Organization of African Unity at Bamako, Mali in January 1991, and came into"}

Impetus for the Bamako Convention arose from criticism of the Basel Convention to prohibit trade of hazardous waste to less developed countries (LDCs), and from the realization that many developed nations were exporting 16 toxic wastes to Africa. The Bamako Convention, but is much stronger in prohibiting all imports of hazardous waste. 2.1.6. Strategic Approach to International Chemical Management (SAICM) It is a policy framework to guide efforts to achieve the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation goal that by 2020 chemicals are purchased and used in ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment. The health sector is central to this given its key roles and responsibilities in the sound management of chemicals. Article 41 of the Constitution lists certain duties and responsibilities associated with the exercise and enjoyment of rights and freedoms, among which is the duty to protect and safeguard the environment. The Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) 296(1) provides that whoever places or permits to be placed, any carrion, filth, dirt, refuse, or rubbish, or any offensive or otherwise unwholesome matter, on any street, yard, enclosure, or open space, except at such places as may be set apart by the local authority or health officer for that purpose commits a punishable offence. The code went further in section 297 (1), to state that when an offence has been committed under section 296 (1) but the offender has not been identified or discovered, the fact of any carrion or other substance mentioned in that subsection being found in front of any premises shall be prima facie evidence of its having been placed there by the occupier of the premises. By going to this extreme, the law seeks to ensure that residents take responsibility for the streets in front of them as well"}

There are similar provisions in the other laws cited above. The National Building Regulations, 1996 (LI 1630) stipulates in Section 145 (1) that a building for residential, commercial, industrial, civic or cultural use shall have a facility for refuse disposal. It went further to state in Section 145 (2) a requirement that each dwelling unit shall have a standardized dustbin or other receptacle approved by the District Assembly in which all refuse generated shall be stored temporarily. It provides for transfer stations to be located within reach and preferably protected from rain and prevention of spreading, pest infestation and scavenging activities and also states that hazardous and domestic refuse shall be treated separately. There are a few existing legal documents which directly gives guidance to Health Care Waste Management; however, they need to be updated and revised. These include: 17 \u2022 The National Sanitation Policy (MLGRD, 1999 & revised 2010) \u2022 Health Care Waste Management Policy and Guidelines (MoH, 2006). \u2022 Guidelines for Management of Health Care and Veterinary Waste, (EPA, 2002). 2.2. National legal and regulatory framework Waste management in Ghana is a multi-sectorial effort with the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resource, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MoLGRD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) playing key roles as implementer and regulator respectively. The responsibility for implementation is discharged through the Municipal, Metropolitan and District, Assemblies (MMDAS) which are directly under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. The Hazardous and Electronic Waste Control and Management Act, 2016 instituted by the EPA has \u201cMedical waste management\u201d as one of its schedules.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE POLICY 3.1. The key principles that informed the policy are as follows: \u2022 The Polluter Pays' Principle was laid down as Principle 16 of the UN Declaration on Environment and Development in Rio 1992. The principle is the commonly accepted practice that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment. For HCWM it implies that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that waste is disposed of, lies with the person or institution that generates the waste. But"}
{"source_file": "HEALTH-CARE-WASTE-MANAGEMENT-POLICY-Final.pdf", "chunk_id": "HEALTH-CARE-WASTE-MANAGEMENT-POLICY-Final_14", "text": "at the same time, there should be laid down steps to dispose of waste if the polluter is unable to pay for its disposal. In Ghana, the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011. \u2022 The Precautionary Principle which advocates for the adoption of measures to protect health and safety when the magnitude of the risk is uncertain. Health facilities should take the necessary steps to protect all workers from risk related to health care waste management. \u2022 The Proximity Principle highlights a need to treat and/or dispose of wastes near their point of generation. The principle works to minimize the environmental impact and cost of waste transport. This is especially important to minimise the risks associated with waste transportation in the urban areas where a lot more health facilities are concentrated, and centralized systems of waste treatment may be recommended. \u2022 The Sustainable Development Principle ensures development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Health care waste technologies and practices should not create damaging effects on environmental resources. \u2022 The Principle of Subsidiarity refers to participation at the lowest 20 appropriate level of decision-making in the health sector. This implies that HCWM is a collective responsibility with all responsible parties on the waste management chain playing their roles efficiently and effectively. HCWM decisions should start from the generation point through to facility management level, regulation at the appropriate health services agency level and finally at the policy level with the ministry of health. \u2022 The Principle of Improving Environmental Equity and Justice focuses on the fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. Every citizen has the right to environmental protection and environmental justice and to live in a safe environment, free from hazardous substances. People should"}

Due to the complexity of the composition of health care waste, no one technology can address all the material flow from health care activities. The principle of complementing one technology with the other should be observed to ensure that all the different categories of waste from health care facilities are properly treated before disposal to ensure a safe environment. \u2022 The Principle of Duty of Care: requires that a worker has a legal and moral obligation to avoid acts or omissions, which could be reasonably foreseen to injure or harm other people. Health care workers have an obligation to adhere to standards of care so that their actions will not cause harm to their clients. In the case of healthcare waste management, every waste generator, manager and handler have a duty to ensure that HCW management practices do not cause harm to people and the environment. \u2022 The \"Prior Informed Consent Principle\" is designed to protect public health and the environment from hazardous waste. It requires that affected communities and other stakeholders be apprised of the 21 hazards and risks and that their consent be obtained. In the context of health care waste, the principle could apply to the transport of waste and the siting and operation of waste treatment and disposal facilities Furthermore, the use of toxic, hazardous compounds such as Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) should be minimized and heavy metals such as mercury shall be phased out as much"}

Signi\ufb01cantly, Ghana has rati\ufb01ed the Be\u0133ing Platform of Action, which urges all governments and other development actors to actively promote a visible policy of mainstreaming gender perspectives in all policies and programmes. As evidence of its commitment to the international treaties and conventions, the Government of Ghana has initiated an A\ufb03rmative Action Programme (AAP) as well as established a Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s A\ufb00airs (MOWAC). The ministry has developed a National Gender and Children\u2019s Policy Framework. The Policy has set a national agenda to mainstream gender concerns in the development process in order to improve the social, legal/civic, political, economic and cultural conditions of the people of Ghana, particularly women and children, which is an integral part of the national development policy. This policy framework guides the development of all sector policies and programmes aimed at evolving a society that is informed and conscious of the rights of children and gender development issues. This Alma A9a Declaration of Health for all in 1977, placed emphasis on \u2018a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being of people and not merely the absence of disease\u2019. The Ministry of Health, taking a cue from the level of government\u2019s commitment to gender issues has since 1999 began an initiative to look at the health sector through a \u2018gender lens\u2019.

This policy document is the outcome of a broad-based consensus building process, which drew on the expertise of a wide range of stakeholders and resource persons from all sectors including Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), the Private Sector, Civil Society Organizations including Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Health development partners have also contributed immensely towards the realisation of this policy document. It is the Ministry\u2019s hope that users of this document will \ufb01nd it useful in mainstreaming gender in the planning and implementation of health sector programmes and that sector gender analysis shall be undertaken to support the prioritization of critical gender related and speci\ufb01c health issues for redress. Dr. George Sipah Yankey Minister of Health 1 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Whilst health needs of both men and women are crucial, gender issues are real and permeate every facet of health promotion and delivery. It is a complex consideration in health choices and needs to be understood and mainstreamed to ensure that the health needs of both men and women are met as well as the roles and responsibilities of men and women working with the health system are equitably considered. Gender equality is important for the achievement of sustainable management and development of the health sector because it ensures that both men and women are in a position to contribute e\ufb00ectively to health delivery and to demand for equitable health services, by recognising gender as one of the factors in\ufb02uencing roles, responsibilities, status and in\ufb02uence in society. Society prescribes to women and men di\ufb00erent roles and responsibilities within di\ufb00erent social contexts. There are also di\ufb00erences in the opportunities and resources available to women and men, and in their ability to"}

Gender roles and unequal gender relations interact with other social and economic variables, resulting in di\ufb00erent and sometimes inequitable pa9erns of exposure to health risk, and in di\ufb00erential access to and utilization of health information, care and services. Although the health sector in Ghana has over the past decades made considerable progress in improving the health status of Ghanaians, it has become evident that these improvements have not been shared by all people living in Ghana. Ghanaians continue to su\ufb00er the burden of infectious diseases, poor reproductive health, malnutrition and non- communicable diseases, which a\ufb00ect their quality of life and life expectancy. This situation has been a9ributed to the fact that li9le 2 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY consideration is given to socio-economic, cultural and other factors that impact on the health of individuals (women and men) in the determination of ill health. In Ghana the promotion of gender equality is mandated by the constitution as well as national frameworks and instruments for gender mainstreaming. The 1992 National Constitution: - Chapter Five makes provision for the equitable engagement of both women and men, and embodies the need to focus on redressing existing imbalances including health accessibility, quality care and also in decision-making. Section 2.8 of Ghana\u2019s National Population Policy (revised, 1994) states: \u201cin view of the woman\u2019s central role in production and reproduction, her importance both as an agent and bene\ufb01ciary of socio-economic development and change cannot be overemphasised\u201d. In addition, section 5.6 of the Population Policy argues that \u201cwomen play an important role in the socio-economic development of the country\u201d. The Decentralisation policy seeks to bring participation in decision making and development closer to communities, and provides a window"}

In 2001 a fully-\ufb02edged Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s A\ufb00airs (MOWAC) was a established. It was given same responsibilities and focus on facilitating the creation of an enabling environment for gender equity and women\u2019s empowerment. Similarly, the e\ufb00orts of MOWAC are to be complemented by the activities of sector ministries and several NGOs, including those of women and civil society in partnership with multi-lateral and bi-lateral development agencies. The ministry\u2019s previous policy documents providing a framework for planning at the various levels of the health delivery system were noted to be gender neutral or gender blind. They failed to recognize that in view of their di\ufb00erent roles, responsibilities, access and control over resources, men and women have di\ufb00erent health needs, priorities, challenges and opportunities, which impact on their health. 3 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY The Ministry has a Gender Commi9ee chaired by the Sector Minister and Gender Desk O\ufb03cers in the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA\u2019s) with dra7 guidelines for the operation of these o\ufb03cers developed. These o\ufb03cers are expected to make inputs into policy formulation in their various MDA\u2019s by way of promoting gender mainstreaming. The Domestic Violence Act 2007, (Act 732) was passed by Parliament on 21st February, 2007 and enacted as law on 3rd May, 2007 with Presidential assent. The Domestic Violence Act provides the long awaited legal environment to empower various actors and professionals to deal more e\ufb00ectively with the problem of domestic violence. The diverse experiences of victims of domestic violence require that systems develop individualized responses to meet victim needs while conforming to best practice.

Domestic violence denies victims and survivors their fundamental rights and undermines human development goals. The health consequences on abused women and the negative psychological and emotional impact on children compromise their well being and undermine development. The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was launched in 2005 as mandated by The National Health Insurance Act 650 (2004) A Legislative Instrument, LI 809 has also been passed to provide operational and administrative guidelines for its implementation. The scheme was initiated to address the problem of \ufb01nancial barriers to health care posed by the \u2018Cash and Carry System\u2019 which requires out- of-pocket payment for health care at the point of service delivery. 4 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY CHAPTER 2 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS OF GENDER ISSUES IN THE HEALTH SECTOR Men and women are di\ufb00erent in terms of their healthcare needs and their disease epidemiology. They also have di\ufb00erent roles to play in their response to health promotion and the reduction of barriers to accessing health services. The concept of gender di\ufb00erentiates the sociologically a9ributed aspects of individuals\u2019 identities from the physiological characteristics of men and women. It refers to the a9ributes and opportunities associated with being male and female and the socio-cultural relationships between women and men which re\ufb02ect the social, cultural, economic, and political roles ascribed to women and men because of their sex di\ufb00erence. The 2000 census indicated a Ghanaian population of 18.9 million, with an annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent. The total fertility rate declined from 6.4 children per woman in 1988 to 4.4 in 2003. The ratio of males to females is 97.9:100 in 2000 indicating that there are more females than males. In response to the growing concerns of gender neutrality, the Ministry of Health in 1999 undertook a"}

This document highlighted some of the gender issues in the health sector and also proposed a framework for action to address them. The study indicated that the current health care delivery interventions have failed to appreciate that gender is relevant to health. The di\ufb00erent roles and responsibilities of women and men, inequities in access to resources, information and power are re\ufb02ected in their health seeking behaviour, their vulnerability to illnesses and quality of care provided them. 5 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY 2.1 INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO GENDER EQUALITY The negative e\ufb00ects of discrimination against women became an international concern during the UN Decade on Women (1975-1985). Since then gender equality promotion and gender mainstreaming has become an area of increasing concern as re\ufb02ected in the recommendations and statements from all the international UN conferences during the 1990s. Ghana has consistently con\ufb01rmed its commitment to gender by ratifying and supporting international commitments to gender equality promotion. Ghana\u2019s sectoral policies and strategies to address gender discrimination and promote women\u2019s rights derive from its own constitution and the international conventions and declarations on gender which provide the legal framework upon which gender equality issues are addressed. These include: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against women (CEDAW), the Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ECOSOC), the UN Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Violence against Women (CEDAW) rati\ufb01ed in 1986, the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights of 1993, the Be\u0133ing Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) declaration of 1994, the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights and"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy_9", "text": "the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa. Ghana\u2019s policy commitments to gender equality promotion with implications on health are also enshrined in the National Plan of Action on Girls Education (1995); the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy 1 (2002); Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (2005); National Gender and Children\u2019s Policy (2004); The National Plan of Action for Women; the National Gender and Children\u2019s Strategy (2004); The Early Childhood Care and Development Policy (2004); the Three Year Strategic Implementation Plan of the Ministry of Women and Children (2005-2008) and the Domestic Violence Law, 2007. Critical to this 6 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY policy is the national response in addressing HIV/AIDS which includes the establishment of National Advisory Council on AIDS (NACA) in 1985 and National Technical Commi9ee on AIDS (NTCA); the National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NACP) in 1987 and the establishment of the Ghana AIDS Commission in September 2000. Ghana has also signed on to a series of key international development targets with direct and speci\ufb01c implications on gender and health provision. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) These include 8 goals, 18 targets and over 40 indicators. The MDGs are to be achieved between 1990 and 2015. The global approach to health and development is increasingly in\ufb02uenced by these MDGs: \u2022 Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women. \u2022 Goal 4: Reduce child mortality - A healthy mother is considered to be the \ufb01rst step towards a healthy child. \u2022 Goal 5: Improve maternal health - The highest proportion of women's ill health burden is related to their reproductive role. \u2022 Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases 2.2 GENDER, HEALTH AND THE GPRS II The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II: 2006 \u2013 2009) focus on health has been outlined to relate to improved"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy_10", "text": "access to health care, malaria control and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The GPRS II envisages that to accelerate access to quality health services, the health sector will continue to deepen e\ufb00orts and focus on the three broad policy objectives: (i) bridge equity gap in access to quality health and nutrition services; (ii) ensure sustainable \ufb01nancing arrangements that protect the poor; (iii) enhance e\ufb03ciency in service delivery. These focus indeed have direct implications on gender since a key factor that 7 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY in\ufb02uences these objectives is individual needs, roles and responsibilities. Gender mainstreaming and women\u2019s empowerment is identi\ufb01ed as cross cu9ing issues and strategies in the GPRS II which calls upon all stakeholders to ensure that its plans and programmes address gender inequality. Critically all the priority areas identi\ufb01ed for health have gender implications. These include Malaria and HIV/AIDS. The susceptibility of pregnant women and children to malaria for instance makes it important to see gender considerations as imperative. The vulnerability of women and girls to HIV/AIDS infections demands some e\ufb00ort at addressing gender and HIV/AIDS issues. Population management is another priority area outlined within the GPRS II with speci\ufb01c strategies which include the promotion, access to and utilization of family planning services; educating the youth on sexual relationships and also, fertility regulation. Issues relating to adolescent health, marriage and child bearing are to be speci\ufb01cally addressed through the promotion of sexual health, delayed marriage and child bearing; promote compulsory education for children especially the girl-child up to secondary school level. 2.3 GENDER AND THE NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY (2007) Currently, the National Health Policy of 2006, themed \u201cCreating Wealth through Health\u201d captures the central role of health in national development for it is only a healthy nation that can be productive (MOH, 2007). The health sector policy has been"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy_11", "text": "designed within the context of Ghana\u2019s vision of achieving middle income status by 2015. According to the document, the strategic direction of improving human capital makes health central to Ghana\u2019s development e\ufb00orts: only a healthy population can bring about improved productivity and subsequent increase in GDP, and by doing so ensure economic growth. Hence the old adage \u201ca healthy population is a wealthy population\u201d. The mission of the Ministry of Health as stated in the policy document 8 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY is to contribute to socio-economic development and wealth creation by promoting health and vitality, ensuring access to quality health, population and nutrition services for all people living in Ghana and promoting the development of a local health industry. This mission puts the concept of health beyond the con\ufb01nes of curative care to other socio-economic determinants of health. The policy document provides a new direction in the development of health in this country, and will serve as the basis for the development of our health sector priorities and planning and therefore has direct implications on gender mainstreaming in the health sector. The policy views health in its broadest sense as a multi-sectoral programme focusing on the physical, social, economic, and spiritual dimensions which can bring total health to individuals, their families and communities. There is therefore a paradigm shi7 from curative action to health promotion and the prevention of ill-health. The policy argues that a healthy population can only be achieved if there are improvements in environmental hygiene and sanitation; proper housing and town planning; provision of safe water; provision of safe food and nutrition; encouragement of regular physical exercise; improvements in personal hygiene; immunization of mothers and children; prevention of injuries in our work places and prevention of road accidents. Implicit in all these are the di\ufb00erent roles"}

Over 90% of these diseases and conditions could easily be prevented if appropriate environmental and lifestyle measures were to be taken. The 9 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY programmes and projects of the Ministry of Health to date, however, have focused on curative care, leading to failures of the Ministry to make a signi\ufb01cant impact in the development of promotive and preventive health to the bene\ufb01t of its people. It is within this context that this new health policy is being proposed. Among key gender issues identi\ufb01ed in the health sector are as follows: \u2022 Access to health care for men and women \u2022 Gender and Life Expectancy \u2022 Communicable and non-communicable diseases \u2022 Sexual and reproductive health \u2022 Gender and HIV/AIDS \u2022 Sexual and gender based violence \u2022 Gender and Mental Health \u2022 Implications of traditional and cultural gender issues on health \u2022 Gender and Nutritional Health \u2022 Emerging Trends and Issues with Gender and Health Implications Relevant to the above is the gender sensitivity of the health service delivery. The Ministry of health conducted a Community Consultative Study in three regions namely Brong Ahafo region, Upper East region and Volta region in 2003 which established the perspectives of partners at the community and district levels on pertinent issues. The study \ufb01ndings reinforced that in seeking medical care, socially ascribed gender roles are reinforced in terms of decisions, consent, resource ownership and control. Access to reproductive"}

This is mainly due to the long distances of communities to the nearest health facility and the operating hours. Certain cultural and religious practices also sometimes delayed or prevented both men and women, (especially women) from seeking health care. The study revealed that some modes of disseminating 10 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY health messages are preferred and regarded as more e\ufb00ective than others. It is noteworthy that the study also revealed some degree of gender-based violence including rape, wife beating and child abuse still exist. These forms of violence have serious e\ufb00ects on the emotional and psychological well being of the women and children. The issue of privacy during consultations and same sex health sta\ufb00 was preferred by most men and women. Certain diseases such as TB, HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and other protracted illnesses were perceived as due to witchcra7 and other spiritual forces. This results in delay in seeking medical a9ention which in turn results in complications and sometimes avoidable deaths. 2.4.1 Access to Health Care Evidence shows that only about one-third of the total population of the country has access to orthodox health care facilities, which are mostly urban-based. The health seeking behaviour of women is generally believed to be low with the exception of women in the reproductive age group. However, empirical evidence also reveals that although there are higher levels of utilization of health facilities by women because of their care giving roles, travelling to health facilities is an added burden to their already heavy domestic schedules. Women\u2019s higher levels of poverty, lower literacy"}

In addition, negative socio- cultural practices such as food taboos, non-involvement in decision- making regarding their health and that of their families also tends to compound this situation. The above factors cause women to delay in seeking health care and in turn results in high maternal mortality. Working hours of most health facilities do not favour most clients especially women, since they have to do household chores and other economic activities. Anecdotal evidence has also revealed that, most service providers are females and this serves as a deterrent to most men in accessing health care, particularly reproductive health services. 11 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY 2.4.2 Quality of service delivery and care Quality of care has been a major issue in the health sector and was identi\ufb01ed as one of the major themes of the \ufb01rst Medium Term Health Strategy (1997-2001). Recent studies have con\ufb01rmed the lack of gender sensitivity on the part of healthcare providers, many of whom have been described as authoritative, insensitive and discourteous. Respect for clients/patients is usually more skewed towards men than women. The negative sta\ufb00 a9itudes of some service providers, which are due to inadequate and poor conditions of service has been found to adversely a\ufb00ect the quality of care. The lack of awareness on the part of clients of the di\ufb03cult circumstances under which health care providers have to work also results in their negative and uncompromising a9itudes to health sta\ufb00. Current service delivery infrastructure in most health facilities does not facilitate client privacy and this a\ufb00ects all clients, especially women. Health Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials for preventive and promotive health activities are o7en gender unfriendly and insensitive to already disadvantaged clients, majority of whom are women and non-literate. Sometimes the messages"}

In most Ghanaian cultures decisions on where and when to seek health care is primarily the preserve of men. This notwithstanding clients, (in particular women) o7en do not have enough information to empower them decide on treatment options. 12 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY Anecdotal evidence shows that health care providers are not alert to the socio-cultural causes of ill health in the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups especially women, adolescent girls and thus do not accord these groups the expected degree of a9ention. 2.4.2.2 Communicable Diseases Biological di\ufb00erences and the socio-cultural environment of men and women have bearing on their presentation and the expression of diseases. Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS and all other communicable diseases are critical diseases, which have exemplary gender dimensions. Therefore in coming out with disease control interventions, the socio-cultural conditions, roles and relationships between men and women should be analyzed. Malaria in Ghana is the single most important cause of mortality especially among children under \ufb01ve years and pregnant women. The disease is responsible for a substantial number of miscarriages and low birth weight babies among pregnant women. Among this group, malaria accounts for 13.8% of Out-patient Department (OPD) a9endance, 10.6% of admissions and 9.4% of deaths. Around 800,000 children under the age of \ufb01ve die from malaria in Africa every year, making this disease one of the major causes of infant and juvenile mortality.

There are also signi\ufb01cant socio-cultural and socio-economic barriers men and women face when seeking TB care and treatment. HIV/AIDS is one of the serious public health challenges in Ghana today with huge gender implications. The current national prevalence 13 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY rate is estimated to be 2.7%) as compared to 3.1% in 2003. The pandemic is taking its toll more on women than men with serious gender dimensions to the disease as a result of women\u2019s anatomical, socio-cultural and economic vulnerability to the disease. With regards to men the case has to be made about masculinities and risky sexual behaviour which are condoned culturally and socially in Ghana. As of 2003 it was estimated that for every man infected with HIV/AIDS two women are infected. Mother to child transmission (MTCT) is the second major means of transmissions, accounting for 15% of new transmission. It was estimated that the prevalence rate among pregnant women was 3.1% in 2006. HIV prevalence among women is also high though that among pregnant women declined from 3.2% to 2.6%, exceeding the target for 2007, and the number of HIV-positive individuals receiving ART doubled from around 6,000 to over 13,000 between 2006 and 2007. 2.4.2.3 Non-communicable Diseases Non-communicable diseases, particularly the cancers (breast, cervical, prostrate and lung) are a growing problem in Ghana.

Cancer of the cervix and breast respectively are the leading cancers among women. They account for 49% and 42% respectively of the cancers of the reproductive system. 2.4.2.4 Mental Health and Gender Based Violence Available health service information indicates that psychiatric illnesses a\ufb00ecting both men and women are on the increase and that the causative factors are di\ufb00erent for the sexes.

Malnutrition including under nutrition in children of poor families, micro-nutrient de\ufb01ciency in children and pregnant women and over-nutrition in adults is known to be an underlying factor in high levels of morbidity and mortality in Ghana. Anaemia forms 1.7% distribution of outpatient a9endance among the ten leading causes of morbidity in Ghana. The nutritional 15 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY status of Ghana is captured as 17 percent underweight, 22.4 percent stunting prevalence and 5.4 percent wasting prevalence. There is also an increase in the number of women (and men) with overweight (obese) problems. Micro-nutrient de\ufb01ciency is high in Ghana. The 2003 DHS found that more than three-quarters of Ghanaian children 6 \u2013 59 months old have some level of anaemia, including 23% of children who are mildly anaemic, 47% who are moderately anaemic and 6% who are severely anaemic. In the case of women aged 15 \u2013 49, the prevalent rates are lower with 45% anaemic, 35% mildly anaemic, 9% moderately anaemic and less than one percent severely anaemic. In case of adults, data from the Ghana Health ervice (GHS) for 2005 on In- Patient Morbidity from January to December, reveals that anaemia was second to malaria as the most reported"}

Men (7716 forming 52%) reported more cases than women (7261 forming 48%) at the in-patient department nationally. On the surface, the fact is clear that men were more anaemic than women and the need for programmes and projects to address this issue has not been that much highlighted in documents reviewed. Also culturally there exist food taboos among some ethnic groups which could prohibit the intake of some vital nutrients with nutritional implications. 2.4.2.6 Sexual and Reproductive Health In Ghana sexual and reproductive health relates critically to the role of men and women in exposing themselves and others to healthy or poor sexual behaviours; family planning particularly access to and acceptability of contraception; women\u2019s risk to abortion; high maternal deaths and general knowledge about reproductive health options and opportunities. The 1985 reform of the criminal code included a law permi9ing abortion if a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or \u201cde\ufb01lement of a female idiot\u201d; if the pregnancy threatens the woman\u2019s physical or mental health; or if there is substantial risk that the child would su\ufb00er from a serious deformity. However, existence of this law does not guarantee women\u2019s access to abortion services. To begin with, safe abortion was not integrated into the national reproductive health policy until 2003. 16 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY In Ghana like elsewhere di\ufb00erent standards are applied to men's and women's sexual behaviour, women o7en have li9le say in their sexual lives and are le7 vulnerable to unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmi9ed infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. A7er improving between 2005 and 2006, institutional Maternal Morality Rate (MMR) worsened between 2006 and 2007 from 197/100,000 to 244/100,000. There is therefore an urgent need to step up e\ufb00orts to address these worsening indicators which indeed is a gender issue that a\ufb00ects mostly women. The following"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy_20", "text": "factors contribute to the high rate of maternal mortality: Insu\ufb03cient knowledge among health sta\ufb00 and community members, especially adolescents on risk factors and danger signs during pregnancy, labour, delivery and the postnatal period expose pregnant women to the risk of death. Inadequate basic emergency obstetric and gynaecological healthcare packages within reach of women and adolescents of childbearing age; for instance, health centres which can provide sustainable services including blood transfusions, theatre services for minor obstetrics and gynaecological emergency operations, ambulance services, et cetera with appropriately trained sta\ufb00. Lack of comprehensive abortion care rather than post abortive care. This issue however needs a legal backing from the A9orney General to develop the Legislative Instrument (L I) before it can properly be rolled out in the country. Inadequate supervision at all health centres, both government, private and NGOs, inadequate number of health workers trained in life saving skills as well as poor communication and transportation system also compounds the problems. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 17 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY Socio-cultural values/stereotypes, negative a9itudes of healthcare providers or lack of customer oriented service by healthcare providers interfere with the right of women and adolescent males and females to family planning and safe abortion services. 2.4.3 Gender and Social Transformation There has been reported progress in poverty reduction in the country since 1990. The proportion of Ghanaians in extreme poverty has declined from 37 per cent to 27 per cent. The Ghanaian society is also transforming from a rural community towards rapid urbanizations. This invariably goes with important changes in gender roles of women and men. Growing phenomenon of female headed households (unexpectedly these seem to be not the poorest) with implications for child care at the household levels (HH) and access to health care (mothers are working, opening hours of health facilities usually"}
{"source_file": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy.pdf", "chunk_id": "Health-Sector-Gender-Policy_21", "text": "only in day-time) and probably many more core-households versus extended family arrangements. These impacts on health and health care. 2.4.4 Management, Governance and Finance The management of the current health delivery system is gender neutral, and therefore, there are no structures and mechanisms to address gender concerns. There is a general gender imbalance at all levels of management positions (district, regional and national) in the health sector. Competent and quali\ufb01ed women who could occupy higher positions are found mainly in the lower and middle levels. Subtle forms of discrimination exist which keeps them out of these positions. Reverse forms of subtle discriminatory practices and a9itudes have also not encouraged men to enter into the nursing and midwifery professions. Most Ministry of Health (MoH) sta\ufb00, especially women, do not know \u2022 18 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY the conditions of service and career opportunities that exist. The prevailing arbitrary career progression opportunities o7en leave the women behind. In many instances, sta\ufb00 postings are not mindful of women and men\u2019s relationships and social roles. Essential facilities in most work places do not take cognisance of the peculiar needs of women (e.g. baby changing, feeding rooms and nurseries etc). There is inadequate analysis of sex disaggregated data and use due to lack of gender oriented pre-service and in-service training for health workers. This constitutes a major constraint to gender considerations in decision-making and ultimately gender mainstreaming in the health sector. All these issues have contributed to inequalities and inequities in the health outcomes of women and men. Hence the need for a policy document that articulates the various dimensions of gender and health to ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into policies and programmes of the health sector. 19 HEALTH SECTOR GENDER POLICY CHAPTER 3 GENDER POLICY FRAMEWORK 3.1 GUIDING PRINCIPLES This policy document"}

Gender equality is also a goal in its own right since discrimination based on gender and sex is an infringement on ones human right. Ghana has commi9ed itself to gender equality and women\u2019s promotion and this is enshrined in its constitution Article 17(2) and 26 (1 and 2). Gender equality promotion is also a goal in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and paramount to all. Gender neutrality of the health delivery system contributes to the inequalities and inequities in the health outcomes of men and women (Promoting Gender Equity in Health, 1999). This situation has also contributed to the unequal opportunities for women and men in the health service thereby establishing the need for a policy document that articulates the various"}

The stated goal of the Health Sector as found in the National Health Policy is: \u2018To ensure a healthy and productive population that reproduces itself safely\u2019 A critical look at the summary of the Ghana Health Pro\ufb01le shows a skewedness towards poor health for women.

Any gender policy developed provides a platform for e\ufb00ectively mainstreaming gender. Mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. It involves ensuring that gender perspectives and a9ention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities: policy development, research, and advocacy/dialogue. Its approaches include legislation, resource allocation and planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes and projects. Gender mainstreaming, therefore, is the systematic integration of the respective situations, priorities and needs of women and men in all policies and with a view to promoting and ensuring equality between women and men. Mainstreaming includes gender in planning and programming and also the development of gender-speci\ufb01c activities. A\ufb03rmative Action is also sometimes emphasized whenever women or men are in a particularly disadvantageous position. Gender-speci\ufb01c interventions, which are necessary temporary measures designed to combat the direct and indirect consequences of past discrimination, can target women exclusively, both women and men, or only men to enable them to participate in and bene\ufb01t equally from the development e\ufb00ort.

In the spirit of the Astana Declaration therefore, the Ministry of Health will promote multisectoral action and UHC, engaging relevant stakeholders and empowering local communities to strengthen PHC, including a better health emergency system. This policy further seeks to address economic, social and environmental determinants of health and aim to reduce risk factors by mainstreaming a Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach. Moreover, the Ministry will involve more stakeholders in the achievement of Health for All, leaving no one behind, while addressing and managing conflicts of interest, promoting transparency and implementing participatory governance. The Ministry of Health will also strive to avoid or mitigate conflicts that undermine health systems and roll back health gains. Ghana has not achieved the desired level of health because we have not adequately addressed, in a comprehensive manner, all the key determinants of health. It is mainly due to this reason that the new National Health Policy (NHP) has been developed to promote, restore and maintain good health for all people living in Ghana. The NHP which is to ensure healthy lives for all people living in Ghana recognizes the wider operational definition of health as being \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well- being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity\u201d (WHO). It further recognizes all organizations, people and their actions which impact on the health of the population and not just those directly involved in the provision of healthcare services.

INTRODUCTION The health and well-being of the Ghanaian population has improved in the last three decades. In1990, Ghanaians on average, when born, lived up to 57 years (life expectancy), out of every 1,000 women who were delivered 6 died (maternal mortality), of all babies born 9% died before age 1 (infant mortality) and 12% died before age 5 (under 5 mortality). By 2017, Ghanaians on average, when born, lived up to 64 years (life expectancy), out of every 1,000 women who were delivered 3 died (maternal mortality), of all babies born 4% died before age 1 (infant mortality) and 5% died before age 5 (under 5 mortality), (GSS, 2014 &2017). Overall, this improvement has been slow and far from the desired Global targets. The changes observed represent an average improvement of 50% as against the desired improvement of 75% in the above indicators (MDG, 2015). Ghana has not achieved the desired level of health because we have not adequately addressed, in a comprehensive manner, all the key determinants of health. Historically, the major health problems affecting Ghanaians have been primarily communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional diseases. Ghana is now acknowledged as having a more complex burden of disease. This is evident across different age, gender, location, and socio-economic status groups in the country. For children, communicable diseases remain the major health conditions affecting them, with malaria prevailing. Maternal and neonatal health conditions remain a challenge, especially in rural areas and amongst poor women. NCDs such as hypertension, strokes, cancers, diabetes, eye disorders, oral health conditions; those of genetic origin such as sickle cell; injuries, substance/"}

With an aging population, conditions such as musculoskeletal and neuro-degenerative disorders are increasing in prevalence. The burden of mental health is also rising, with an estimated prevalence for common mental health ailments (depression and anxiety) of 10%. 3% of the total Ghanaian population have some form of disability with visual or sight impairment being the most common. The above is further compounded by the complex interactions between conditions and the presence of co-morbidities (GSS, 2014). This complex disease burden is influenced by risk factors such as the physical environment, education, socio-economic situation, population lifestyles and demographic characteristics of the Ghanaian population. These, in addition to the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to provide quality care, collectively determine the health and well-being of people living in Ghana (GBD, 2016). In recognition of the complex nature of the disease pattern and the increasing influence of other health risk factors on population health and well-being, Ghana must, whiles strengthening the healthcare delivery system, simultaneously address the other determinants of health. 2 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 1.1 Scope of Policy The policy, which is to ensure healthy lives for all people living in Ghana, recognizes the wider operational definition of health as being \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity\u201d (WHO). It further recognizes all organizations, people and their actions which impact on the health of the population and not just those directly involved in the provision of healthcare services. 1.2 Policy Development and Review Process The National Health Policy was developed under the stewardship of the Minister for Health. The process leveraged the Health Sector Working Group Platform for strategic guidance under the"}

The day-to-day work was done by a Task Team within the Policy Coordination Unit of the MOH, as the Secretariat. A policy think tank was formed to provide technical support for the Task Team. The National Health Policy was developed through an evidence-based and extensive participatory processes involving reviews of relevant documents, consultations and dialogue with stakeholders. These stakeholders included the Ministry of Health and its agencies and departments, related professional bodies and private health sector actors. Other sector Ministries, multilateral and bilateral development partners, private sector, patient groups, civil society and the National Development Planning Commission were all involved. 3 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 2. POLICY CONTEXT AND FRAMEWORK This policy derives inspiration from the Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 34 (2) of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana-which among others requires the state to ensure the realization of the right to good healthcare for people living in Ghana irrespective of colour, race, geographical location, religion and political affiliation.It is expected that all political actors shall be guided by the tenets of this policy and provide the needed leadership and support for its implementation. It has also been inspired by the overall national medium-term policy development framework developed by the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), as well as the Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies (2017-2024). The policy recognizes several global, regional and sub-regional compacts and policy frameworks. The following, among others, are mentioned here: the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on the theme, \u201cTransforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d, the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the Astana Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC), the African Union (AU) Vision 2063:"}

To this end, the implementation of the National Health Policy will focus on improved collaboration with, and increased ownership and commitment of the local government sector and sub-structures to ensure no one is left behind in the attainment of good health. 2.4.4 Equity This policy recognizes that the disease burden and its impact on segments of the population is influenced by the national demographics, geographical distribution and the socio-economic status of the population. Interventions and resources required to meet these needs of the population where they are will necessarily be different. These needs shall be addressed in an equitable and not an equal manner. 2.4.5 Citizen\u2019s Involvement and Social Accountability This policy recognizes that the primary responsibility for the health"}

POLICY OBJECTIVES This policy has 5 objectives, namely i. To strengthen the healthcare delivery system to be resilient ii. To encourage the adoption of healthy lifestyles iii. To improve the physical environment iv. To improve the socio-economic status of the population v. To ensure sustainable financing for health These objectives shall collectively ensure that there will be improved alignment, complementarity and synergies within and across all public sector ministries as well as with other stakeholders, towards achieving the national health goal. The policy shall therefore ensure that MDAs and other identifiable organizations work within the principles of the Health-in-All Policy and the One-Health Policy frameworks (WHO), to achieve the desired healthy life status of people living in Ghana. 3.1 Policy Objective 1: To strengthen the healthcare delivery system to be resilient Ghana is committed to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). UHC in Ghana mean all people in Ghana have timely access to high quality health services irrespective of ability to pay at the point of use. Access: Over the years there has been a progressive increase in the provision of infrastructure and equipment, as well as the design and delivery of services. Yet timely access to services remains inequitable with respect to healthcare facilities and package of services (preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative).Services are further not appropriately designed to account for populations with unique needs such as the disabled, aged, persons with genetic disorders, accident victims, people affected by natural and man-made disasters, adolescents, as"}

Services will be delivered, through an enhanced coordinated network of facilities (CHPS compounds, health centres and hospitals etc.), both public and private, that collectively provides the appropriate package of healthcare services (preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative using a life-course approach) to the population. Quality: At all levels and for all services quality has been a challenge. The quality of healthcare services in Ghana has been described as \u201cinadequate\u201d by both objective and anecdotal assessments by providers and clients (NQS, 2016; MOH, 2017). There is unclear oversight and fragmentation in the quality approaches with limited impact 6 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 on patient experience and health outcomes. Several initiatives to improve the quality of care in the health system of the country has led to the development and launch of a 5-year National Healthcare Quality Strategy (2017-2021). The policy thrust is to develop a robust and sustainable quality culture institutionalized in the healthcare delivery system with clear measurable standards in terms of safety, efficiency, effectiveness, timeliness, equity and patient-centredness. Financial Risk: The cost of care is still considered to be out of the financial reach of the majority of the population thus posing financial risk to them. It is estimated that only 35% of the Ghanaian population has financial risk protection due to their active membership of the NHIS. This policy will ensure the strengthening of the NHIS, as well as encourage the population to subscribe to the NHIS and other private insurance schemes where appropriate.

The policy will seek to strengthen surveillance and response systems to prevent, detect, investigate, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the spread of diseases resulting from epidemics and disasters. The system shall operate across all levels (community, district, metropolitan, regional and national) and recognize the animal-human interface as well (one-health). This policy will seek to strengthen acute emergency care services involving pre-hospital (including ambulance services) and hospital emergency services required for disasters and situations with mass casualties. The healthcare delivery system will be strengthened to achieve Universal Health Coverage meaning: all persons living in Ghana will have the opportunity to access quality healthcare services they require, wherever they are, with cost of care not being a barrier. To achieve UHC and emergency preparedness the healthcare delivery system needs to be strengthened. The healthcare delivery system recognizes 11 areas requiring strengthening namely: 1.

In spite of the increasing trend, the health system is not structured to meet the growing health needs of the aged. Geriatric healthcare delivery is almost non-existent and where available not fully integrated into the general healthcare system. The focus of service delivery, in general, has also not adequately addressed population cohort-specific disease conditions and the rising burden of NCDs. Ghana has over the years, established discrete programmes such as Malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS, NTDs, RMNCAH, and NCDs. In response to specific health and disease problems. The challenge remains how to ensure that these programmes are fully integrated as a package and how to ensure their financial sustainability. The design and delivery of healthcare services shall adopt a life course approach to make it increasingly and appropriately reflective of the complex nature of Ghana\u2019s disease burden and ensure the availability of equitable care for respective population cohorts. Family and other traditional systems that offer care and support for the elderly will be encouraged and strengthened. The provisions of elderly-friendly health service centres, as well as special social protection and safety net programmes for them will be pursued. The policy will create an enabling environment that supports and promotes the establishment of rehabilitation and palliative care services. In addition, the policy will ensure that challenges of access to care by persons with any form of disability, including discrimination and stigmatization, are removed. 8 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 3.1.2 Strategy: Ensure equitable access to the appropriate quality and quantity of health workers Human resources for health (HRH) are increasingly recognized as crucial to the improved performance of the health system.

The operation of health training institutions will be streamlined and improved. There will be a conscious effort to recognize and support the training of specialist cadres of all categories of health professionals. 3.1.3 Strategy: Increase availability and use of appropriate health technology/ infrastructure There are inadequate health infrastructure in terms of health facilities and equipment availability. In addition, available facilities and equipment are often inefficiently and sub-optimally utilized. Existing technology, infrastructure and equipment have predominantly focused on supporting the provision of preventive and curative care with little emphasis on rehabilitative and palliative care services. Government will focus on the modernization/re-tooling of existing facilities, rationalize the construction and siting of additional purpose-built facilities, promote the availability and use of high-quality assistive devices and technologies (including prostheses, orthoses etc.) at an affordable cost. Comprehensive Health Technology Assessments (HTA) will be institutionalized and inform the selection and procurement of all medical technologies required. 3.1.4 Strategy: Ensure the availability and appropriate use of quality medicines and medical products There are substandard and falsified medicines and medical products that have infiltrated and are easily available in the Ghanaian market. These substandard and falsified medicines are in themselves dangerous, as well as lead to ineffective treatment, thus complicating and prolonging ill-health and disease.

In addition, the availability, affordability, 9 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 efficacy and overall quality of medicines and medical products for all recognized forms of medical practice, will be pursued. This will be done through strengthened regulation and the promotion of local production of these medicines and medical products as well as working within the One Health strategic framework to combat antimicrobial resistance. 3.1.5 Strategy: Increase efficiency, accountability and prudent use of financial resources The health sector has recently seen increases in health revenue in absolute/nominal terms although it is losing ground as a percentage of GDP. The proportion of funding from public, private and international funds has reduced dramatically over the last five years and can generally be characterized as a shift from international funding of the health sector to Ghana public funding (HA Report, 2017). There is a relatively low fiscal space affecting public revenue allocation to the health sector, declining development partner funding, inadequate innovative domestic resource mobilization, poor exemption-targeting mechanisms and unrealistic tariff regime. The health sector is also facing challenges with efficiency in the allocation and use of public funds, general wastage, process and procedure infractions and Value-For-Money breaches. (Report of the Auditor-General, the Public Accounts of MDAs, 2016). There is therefore the need for innovative ways of domestic resource mobilization, ensuring accumulation, efficiency, equity and accountability in the allocation and use of funds.

The existing health regulatory agencies (FDA, MDC, NMC, Pharm C, HeFRA, AHC, and TAMC etc.) and other institutions will be supported to fairly and objectively execute their mandates. For existing and new areas of practice and service (e.g. diagnostic imaging, organ transplant, surrogacy, stem cell banking etc.) where well- defined regulatory frameworks and bodies may not exist these shall be established. 3.1.7 Strategy: Enhance access to care and the timely use of accurate reliable data. The availability of accurate, reliable data and information, in real time is key to the successful performance of any health system.

Whiles the public sector provides primarily orthodox care the private sector comprises different types of healthcare models including orthodox, traditional and alternative medicine practitioners. The potential synergies that can be leveraged by this rich mix of providers has not been adequately leveraged to improve the health of the population as desired. The healthcare delivery system, at all levels, will work in formal strategic partnerships with the local government systems as well as private sector stakeholders (CSOs, health and non-health industry players). Pluralism in service delivery will be encouraged and supported. 3.1.9 Strategy: Enhance community ownership and participation Community participation is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable development, this is also true for sustainable population health. The involvement of communities in the design, planning and development of health interventions facilitates the achievement of high levels of commitment, ownership and empowerment of communities to champion interventions to improve their own health. Communities and/or their representatives shall be empowered and actively sought to be involved and participate in the design and implementation of health interventions. 3.1.10 Strengthen research to inform policy and management decision making Health research to provide evidence is paramount to the continuous learning and development of any health system. However, currently there is little focus on strengthening the research to evidence and practice framework in the health sector. Issues about research funding, integrated national research agenda and capacity are suboptimal.

Governance approaches and capacity have not achieved the levels of effectiveness and efficiency desired. There is the need for commitment to collaborating with local governance structures to facilitate effective health service delivery and well-being of the population. There is non-alignment and minimal cooperation of the healthcare delivery system with the political administration at the local government level (M/ DHMT). These foregoing factors are setbacks in the attempts to improving health outcomes of the local population in more efficient and cost-effective ways. Appropriate legislation on governance will be developed and where appropriate existing ones revised to enable leadership to provide direction, be accountable, ensure compliance, partner with local government and be innovative towards providing quality, equitable and low financial risk services. 3.2 Policy Objective 2: Encourage the adoption of healthy lifestyle Individual lifestyle behaviours such as diet and exercise; tobacco, alcohol and drug use; as well as sexual activity, among others, are noted to have a major impact on health. The impacts of these are seen more in the genesis of Non-Communicable Diseases in particular. The population will be empowered and supported to proactively take measures to adopt healthy lifestyles. 3.2.1 Strategy: Promote Healthy Eating Dietary changes in low-and middle-income countries from a more traditional to a westernized diet cannot be overemphasized.

Promote the development of appropriate programmes for reducing the incidence and prevalence of nutritional disorders, intensify efforts to provide systematic education on food and nutrition to the population. 3.2.3 Strategy: Increase physical activity The 2014 Ghana Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth indicated that less than 40% of Ghanaian children and youth participated in any amount of physical activity. Another study revealed that only about 24.5% of the target population regularly exercised (Obiri korang et al., 2016). Being physically active is one of the most important steps that Ghanaians, of all ages, can take to improve their health and reduce the incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases. A good balance between rest, recreation and physical activity cannot be overemphasized. Researches have shown that sedentary behavior contributes to a host of chronic diseases. The policy shall ensure that the individual is encouraged to enjoy and enjoys adequate rest, and shall support the development of recreational and physical activity facilities for regular use of the"}

Substance abuse impacts everyone\u2019s family and life at one time or another. It does not discriminate based on socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity. It is estimated that 23.3 % of persons aged 15 years and above take alcohol, with 2.1% of the population engaged in heavy drinking. Per capita consumption of beer is 30%; wine, 10%; spirits, 3%; and locally brewed 57%. It is also estimated that 10% of adults and 4% of junior high school students also smoke cigarettes with 9.7% males and 0.4% females smoking cigarette(GDHS, 2014). The implementation of the provisions of existing legislation and International Conventions on narcotics, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals will be ensured, through enforcement and control, education and preventive measures, as well as treatment and rehabilitation of persons suffering from drug addiction. (NACOB) 13 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 In addition, abstinence from alcohol or moderation in alcohol consumption will be encouraged and promoted through the strengthening of regulations on the production, marketing and sale of alcoholic beverages. (Alcohol Policy) The Mental Health Act, 2012 (Act 846) has been enacted to raise the level of Mental Health Care, de-emphasize institutional care and protect the right of persons with mental disorders. Full implementation of the Mental Health Policy shall be supported. 3.2.5 Strategy: Encourage and promote safe and responsible sexual behaviour Sexual and reproductive health affect and are affected by the broader context of personal lifestyle, the economic circumstances, education, employment, living conditions, family environment and gender relationship including the"}

Unsafe sexual behaviours are common among the youth making them vulnerable to the risk of unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection including HIV. It is estimated that 14% of adolescents aged 15-19 are already mothers or pregnant with their first child and the direct and indirect cost of HIV on the lives of individuals and the population is significant. The population shall be empowered to make informed choices towards the adoption of sexual activities and behaviours that do not lead to ill-health and disease. There will be the provision of high-quality services for family planning, including infertility services and aggressively fight sexually transmitted infections including HIV, reproductive tract infections, cervical cancer and other gynaecological morbidities. There will also be advocacy and facilitation of the integration of sexuality education in the school curriculum. 3.3 Policy Objective 3: To improve the physical environment The physical environment, in particular water, sanitation and hygiene; air, noise and hazardous waste pollution; housing and human settlements; and the safety of our transport systems are acknowledged to impact the health of the Ghanaian population. The capacity to address and mitigate the negative impact of these on health lies within the mandates and jurisdiction of other sector Ministries. Though these other sectors appreciate the need for collaboration and integrated planning with the Ministry of Health, towards improved population health, this has not been effectively achieved to leverage the potential of the synergies amongst these sectors.This policy recognizes that effective inter-sectoral collaboration is critical in achieving our national health aspirations. 3.3.1 Strategy: Improve access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene Consumption pattern and activities due to economic growth puts pressure on the assimilative capacity of the environment.

A decline in access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene has negative consequences on population health. According to the 2017/2018 MICS, 79% of households in Ghana had access to basic drinking water, 7% had access to limited water, 5% to unimproved and 9% surface water. For basic sanitation, 21% had access to basic sanitation, 45% to limited, 13% to unimproved and 22% engaged in open defecation. Availability of basic hygiene facilities nationwide was 48%, 24% for limited service and 28 % had no hygiene facilities at all. The WASH situation was worse in rural areas than urban areas. The policy will ensure that the population shall have access to potable water, improved sanitation and hygiene facilities. 3.3.2 Strategy: Reduce the harmful effect of Air, noise and hazardous substances The health impact of air quality, noise and hazardous substances has a great effect on health and well-being of the citizenry. The population shall have access to clean air and a reduction in exposure to harmful noise levels as well as hazardous substances in the environment. 3.3.3 Strategy: Improve Human Settlements and Housing More than half of the population lives in urban areas, the percentage of the urban population has increased from about 23 percent (1960) to 50.9 percent (2010). Rapid urbanization has contributed to worsening housing situation especially in the urban areas with overstretched social amenities resulting in soaring rents, overcrowding, and building of unauthorized structures and slums. Human settlement and housing will be designed to promote sustainable spatial integration, balanced and orderly development so as to safeguard the natural environment and ensure that it protects the population from all potential hazards prevailing in the local environment (physical and"}

A safer transportation system is paramount to the health and wellbeing of the population. It is increasingly becoming topical with recorded cases of accidents leading to loss of lives and life changing injuries. Over 90% of the world\u2019s fatalities on the road occur in low and middle-income countries including Ghana (Global Status Report on Road Safety). According to estimates in 2013, the number of road traffic deaths in Ghana stood at 6,789 (5,877 \u2013 7,011). (WHO Global Health Observatory Data Repository) The estimated road traffic death rate (per 15 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 100,000 population) in 2013 was also pegged at 26.2. Reports also indicate that Ghana loses about 1.6% of GDP annually in resolving incidences of road traffic accidents such as medical expenses of victims, damage to vehicles and insurance cost, property damage and loss of productive hours among others (Mends-Brew et al., 2018). The transportation system in Ghana shall be made safer by providing a modern, integrated and well-maintained transportation infrastructure (for land, air and sea) as well as ensuring an enhanced technical capacity and competence of users. 3.4 Policy Objective 4: Improve the socio-economic status of the population The manifestos of all political parties, over the years, have consistently reflected cross- cutting national health aspirations aimed at improving the health and quality of life of everyone living in Ghana. The objective of Government\u2019s social development policies and programmes is to achieve a fair and inclusive society. There has always been strong commitment and political will, at all levels, towards improving the health of people living in Ghana. Internal population movements are influenced by the desire"}

The hope of getting employment and a better life elsewhere, fleeing from internal conflicts among others continue to fuel recent rural-urban migration especially among the youth. This policy recognizes education, employment, family and social support and community security as important socio-economic determinants of the health of people living in Ghana. To achieve this objective the following strategies shall be pursued: 3.4.1 Strategy: Develop population capacity to be economically productive A people with the appropriate knowledge, skills and competencies are able to engage in productive economic activities to cater for their health and other needs. Evidence from the GLSS 6 shows that about 77% of the youth had basic education qualifications or less, coupled with challenges in the economy; it is difficult for them to compete for the few decent jobs available. An all-inclusive and equitable educational system that produces well-balanced individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills, values, aptitudes and attitudes to become functional, productive and healthy citizens will be pursued. 3.4.2 Strategy: Increase the Employment Status of the Population Employment and working conditions have powerful effects on health equity. Employees either on their own or with support from their employers are able to access care and improve their standard of living. Workplaces provide a perfect environment to influence employees\u2019 health. Employment growth has generally been slower than overall 16 National Health Policy: Ensuring healthy lives for all Revised Edition | January 2020 economic growth, raising concerns about the quality of Ghana\u2019s economic growth (CPESDP 2017-2024). The hope of getting employment and a better life elsewhere, fleeing from internal conflicts among others continue to fuel rural-urban migration especially among the youth, in search of better jobs and livelihoods. It is therefore imperative for government to work at improving"}

The policy shall promote the creation of decent jobs and occupational health and safety for all workers. The policy shall ensure the creation of an enabling environment for the establishment of industries in the rural areas to provide employment. It shall also promote equity in allocation of social amenities in deprived areas; promote conflict prevention and non-violent disputes settlement within the national fabric. 3.4.3 Strategy: Strengthen family and social support systems Due to poverty and lack of opportunities in the rural areas, child trafficking to the urban centres to engage in exploitative labour has also become rampant. About 23.4% of children aged 5\u201314 years engaged in some form of economic activities, and were mainly involved in mining and quarrying, apprenticeships and domestic helps (GLSS- 2013). Domestic violence is also becoming an issue with DOVVSU reporting 23.4% of such cases in 2013.There is therefore the need to forestall these phenomena in our national fabric. The policy will ensure the development of socially supportive and integrated societies that offer equal opportunity for both men and women, safeguard the rights of children, and empower the vulnerable, including the aged and persons with disabilities and special needs. 3.4.4 Strategy: Improve community security Security within our communities is in recent times becoming an issue. Cases of kidnapping, assassinations, burglary, thuggery and communal violence are well documented. A decade aggregate (2000\u20132010) report of crime cases recorded for Accra alone were: murder (5,313), assault (972,222), armed robbery (12,069), theft (801,483) and Narcotics (5,481) (Owusu et al., 2016).

As an LMIC, Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Ghana\u2019s health sector is projected to dwindle to health as well as other sectors of the economy (World Bank, 2018). The \u201cGhana Beyond Aid\u201d policy statement further introduces a shift in national development financing from reliance on external aid to local resources. Ghana, however, has not been able to mobilize adequate domestic resources for health services delivery. There is therefore the need to explore sustainable innovative ways of financing health in Ghana. The policy recognizes that adequate financial support will be required for the implementation of the respective sectoral plans and budgets. Respective sectoral plans and budgets, in support of the health policy, shall be made in line with the National Budgeting and Planning cycle of the government. 3.5.1 Strategy: Increase domestic resource mobilization (DRM) and accountability Enhancing domestic resource mobilization and the efficient use of funds is an essential mechanism for ensuring that adequate financial resources are available to support the implementation of required interventions. This is paramount within the context of LMIC status, \u201cGhana Beyond Aid\u201d policy, and the complex epidemiological transition of Ghana. There is therefore the need to develop and institutionalize a functional DRM mechanism towards the health and well-being of the population.

[5] FOREWORD Improvement in maternal and child health has been identified by His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama as the number one policy priority in the Health Sector under the Better Ghana Agenda of the Government. According to the latest estimate by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (MMEIG), the MMR in Ghana was 319 per 100,000 live births in 2015. The country was therefore unable to achieve its MDG target of 185 per 100000 live births. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), a more ambitious target to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births has been set, and"}

With the expiry of the MDGs and the advent of the SDGs the global community has garnered hither-to-fore unprecedented concerted global action in this regard. However, despite this effort there is general acknowledgement of unfinished agenda in terms of achieving the MDGs 4 and 5 at global, regional and national levels. There is therefore need to ensure sustained action to address the gaps in the MDGs. As Government we reaffirm our strong commitment to the full implementation of this new Agenda. We recognize however, that we will not be able to achieve our ambitious Goals and targets without a revitalized and enhanced partnership with all stakeholders. We will therefore mobilize and engage government, civil society, Development partners, the private sector and the communities and put together all available resources to meet the targets. Hon. Alexander Percival Segbefia Minister of Health, Ghana [6] BACKGROUND: Over the past decades Ghana has invested strongly in maternal and reproductive health care to support attainment of its development goals. Several high level initiatives have been launched in the country since 1990 to enhance progress towards MDG5, of which Making Pregnancy Safer Initiative, CARMMA and MDG5 acceleration framework(MAF) are amongst the most notable. Ghana is signatory and staunch supporter to a number of key frameworks that drive the Maternal and Reproductive Health global agenda such as ICPD PoA, MDG and FP2020. A predictable result of this commitment was a considerable improvement of both the coverage of Maternal and Reproductive Health services and associated health outcomes. The percentage of deliveries occurring in a health facility has increased from 42% in 1988 to 73% in 2014. The percentage of births attended by a skilled provider has increased from 40% to 74% over the same period. 97% of women in Ghana receive antenatal care from"}

This percentage has increased steadily from 82% in 1988 to 97% in 2014 (DHS 2014). Nevertheless, these investments have fallen short of putting the country on track to reach the 75% reduction of the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) required by the MDG5. According to the latest estimate by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (MMEIG), the MMR in Ghana has fallen from 634 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 376 per 100,000 live births in 2005 and is currently 319 per 100,000 live births in 2015. The slow progress has been of great concern to policy/decision makers to the extent that Maternal Mortality was declared a national emergency in July 2008. Responding to these concerns Ghana\u2019s MDG5 Acceleration Framework (MAF) was developed by the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service in collaboration with development partners, particularly the United Nations Country Team and other stakeholders in Ghana in 2010. Its aim is to augment implementation of the Maternal and Child Health programme with the objective of attaining the MDG indicators and targets. Following that, a costed Operational Plan was developed in 2011 to guide implementation of the MAF. The focus of the MAF and its Operational Plan is primarily on MDG 5 although investments in improving access and quality of Skilled Delivery, EmONC and child spacing will have a strong impact on neonatal and infant mortality as well (MDG4). The MAF focuses on improving maternal health at the level of both community and health care facilities using evidence-based, feasible and cost-effective interventions in order to achieve accelerated reduction in maternal and newborn deaths. The three key priority interventions identi\uf001ed are improving family planning, skilled delivery and emergency obstetric and newborn care. The MAF was not aimed at replacing existing policies or programmes. Rather, it is meant"}

Governing Structure of MAF: MAF is implemented nationwide in all districts. A National Steering Committee (NSC) provides overall governance and policy oversight for MAF implementation. The NSC is chaired by the Minister of Health and has membership that includes DPs/UN agencies, MoH, GHS, CSOs, NHIA etc. Four technical subcommittees aid the work of the National Steering Committee: Procurement, Behavioural& Social Change Communication (BSCC), Human Resource and M&E. FIGURE 1: MAF GOVERNING STRUCTURE A MAF Secretariat has been established within the MoH PPME Directorate. The secretariat\u2019s role is to support the NSC to provide oversight and strategic direction to the implementation of the MDG acceleration framework. More specifically the functions of the secretariat as per the ToR agreed between the Ghana MoH and the UN are as follows: 1. Coordination and liaison with the NSC and the MAF implementing agencies 2. Development and operationalization of MAF M&E and reporting standards 3. Technical support for MAF implementation oversight 4. Support effective functioning of the NSC, which includes organising quarterly NSC meetings and preparing MAF programme reports [8] The MoH MAF secretariat works closely with the M&E unit, Procurement and Finance directorates of the MoH, MAF subcommittees as well as the GHS, CHAG, Teaching Hospitals to fulfil the above functions.

Each agency that implements components of MDG Acceleration Framework (GHS, National Teaching Hospitals, CHAG, MoH Procurement Directorate) has a unit that oversees implementation of MAF and reports to the MOH MAF Secretariat on a quarterly basis on the progress against MAF targets. MAF IMPLEMENTATION 2013-15 Implementation The Financing Agreement between the Government of Ghana and the European Union for MAF was signed in October 2012. In view of this, the first tranche of 10million Euros was disbursed to the Ministry of Health in April, 2013 for implementation of the MAF Strategy. Operationalization of the plan made a strong contribution to addressing the bottlenecks in maternal health care identified during development of the MAF. By mid-year 2014 over 1171 community health nurses had been trained to insert implants in line with policy. An analysis of activities planned and undertaken to date is at Annex 1. In 2015 a MAF Strategy and Operational plan was developed and signed off by the Minister of Health. Despite rigorous planning, the 2015 MAF operational plan suffered from a number of setbacks. There was lack of general consensus among major donors on the plan. While DANIDA agreed with and executed the plan, EU did not approve the 2015 Operational Plan citing that it did not adequately reflect the targets set in the MAF Strategy and was skewed towards training and governance activities and less so to activities that would directly save the lives of mothers. Using DANIDA funding,"}

Annex 3 shows procurement done with DANIDA funding against original MAF procurement requirements. There were challenges with alignment of the actual implementation of activities with the approved plans. Late receipt of Funds affected the execution of the various activities. The regions did not receive any funding until the third quarter of the year (2015). Execution of the plan was overall fragmented, skewed towards training, while procurement and distribution of equipment lagged behind. According to a Joint Monitoring Report (November 2015) Implementation of 2015 planned activities was at best modest. The original activity plan and budget was reduced significantly such that only activities [9] related to training were met by the agencies. Procurement activities had started but were not yet completed. A distribution plan was developed but equipment was yet to be distributed to facilities. Challenges Despite the progress made towards achieving Ghana MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) targets a number of challenges impaired its scale and effectiveness. These challenges are diverse in nature and relate to the framework\u2019s financing, implementation, reporting, coordination and governance. Financing: The first and possibly the most serious impediment for effective implementation of MAF Operational Plan is its financing that remains fragmented and inadequate. Of the $313,433,060.00 required to bridge the gaps identified in the MAF Operational Plan1 funding of only 10 million euros from the European Union and about 7 million USD from UNFPA can be reliably verified. Funding for the MAF from other sources, including from the Government of Ghana and other the DPs was less tangible, although it is deemed to be sizeable and played a crucial role in facilitating the progress against the MAF targets.

A rigorous prioritisation was therefore undertaken to ensure that the available resources are directed to support the most effective activities of the MAF plan. In 2015 the European Union disbursed Euro 31,249,800.00 of which the first tranche of Euro 19,999,900.00 hit the MOH account on the 2nd December 2015. The second tranche of Euro 11,249,900.00 has also been credited on to the MOH account in February 2016. Even though the funds were disbursed in July, 2015, there was a delay period of up to 6 months before they were was transferred into the account of the MoH. Programme M&E and Reporting The MAF operational plan contains a number of well-defined progress indicators and description of governance and coordination structures to enable effective program M&E and reporting. In 2015 the MAF funds released to implementing agencies were however meagre and uneven and this curtailed implementation of planned activities at all levels of MAF implementation. In the absence of specific MAF funding, it was difficult to track the MAF operational plan activities as these were often subsumed into the normal MAF-related activities at each of the levels MAF 2016/17 OPERATIONAL PLAN Process of reviewing MAF operational plan Recognising the implementation and financial challenges set out above, the Ministry of Health, following discussion at the NSC, embarked on developing the 2016 operational plan, identifying activities and procurements most likely to contribute to the attainment of the gaols of MAF within 1 Government of Ghana.

Following the submission of the agency-specific work plans, the MAF Secretariat collated the activities in one national plan to facilitate analysis of the proposals from implementing agencies. It then worked with the agencies and with the use of further bilateral meetings, to prioritize activities based on the Sogakope policy orientation and MAF steering committee recommendations. Part of this process included full engagement with the main donors (the EU and DANIDA).

For reference, the original list is shown in Annex 3. The procurement initially started in 2013 and was re- activated in 2015 using DANIDA funds and will be completed by early 2016 (the first wave). As part of the 2016 planning, an initial assessment of needs of further equipment was carried out by implementing partners The full list of items to be procured as the second wave is at Annex 4. This list was chosen based on the original needs submitted by the implementing partners and was guided by both the Sogakope policy orientation and gaps assessment in the original MAF plan. The list was also influenced by emerging agency-specific needs as expressed during agency-specific planning.

The Government is committed to improving the health status of all Ghanaians. Among the many resources to be mobilized to this end are human resources. Human resource development has in the past received some attention though inadequate. In 2002, the Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a five-year (2002-2006) policy and strategy document, Human Resources for the Health, to serve as a guide to implementing agencies, both public and private. Unfortunately, the strategies outlined in that document were not fully implemented, creating significant gaps in human resource management in the health sector. The MOH and its agencies have realized the need to review the Human Resources for the Health 2002-2006 policy strategy to address the existing human resource gaps as well as the current challenges facing the sector. Today, we stand on the threshold of significant national development. It has become even more critical that we undertake a complete shift of paradigm in our health goals and policies to strategies that will ensure wealth creation for the nation. This will require harmonization of national health policies with the development of human resources for health in both public and private sectors. This policy document outlines the position of the MOH Human Resources by providing a basis for decision making regarding planning, training, recruitment, deployment and management.

It then sets out to address those gaps. The introduction provides the health workforce direction for the short to medium term built around the conceptual framework of national development goals and the policy direction of the MOH. It provides the HRH vision and objectives for the next five years. The chapter also outlines the methodology used in the design of the document. The second chapter presents the current HRH situation. This part presents the projected population and available health facilities in Ghana. Currently there are approximately 69,000 people involved in health care delivery. Out of this number only 52,200 are formally known and recognized. Of this, the MOH employs about 42,300. The staff includes: \u2022 2,026 medical officers; \u2022 1,550 pharmacists; \u2022 31 dental surgeons; \u2022 7,304 general professional nurses; \u2022 2,956 enrolled nurses; \u2022 3,246 community health nurses; \u2022 2,810 nurse midwives; \u2022 588 allied health professionals; and \u2022 27,918 non-clinical and clinical support staff. The situation indicates a sector with very weak mid-level personnel staffing, excessive support staff, an inadequate staff mix and imbalances in health workforce distribution, and weak institutional capacities for human resource information, supervision and monitoring. This section also reveals the increasing cost in human resource financing. It briefly outlines the main human resource challenges for the health sector. The third chapter presents the projected health sector goals. It provides current as well as the projected human resource requirements, standards and vacancies for the next five years of the key health sector workforce. This chapter also presents the training projections indicating anticipated inputs, dropouts and outputs. It then links requirements to training projections and identifies gaps to be filled. Chapter four is on the HRH policies and strategies. It examines HRH issues and identifies key policy questions."}

The human resource policy direction in the last five years has focused on increasing production and retention of staff, and equipping them with the relevant tools to provide health care to all Ghanaians. The current reforms in the health sector demand additional policy interventions on human resource management (HRM) for sustainable human resource development towards improved health care delivery. The policies enshrined in this document are derived from a conceptual framework on global health workforce issues, national development goals, and the next five-year policy direction of the MOH. Global Health Workforce There is a chronic shortage of well-trained health workers globally. This shortage is due to: \u2022 migration to well-developed countries; \u2022 a non-propagating health workforce; \u2022 poor staff retention mechanisms in less developed countries, including poor salaries and benefits; \u2022 illness and death; and \u2022 other uncontrollable factors, e.g. spouses joining their partners. The WHO estimates the current full-time health workforce to be 59.2"}

Out of this, health service providers constitute about two-thirds, while the remaining third comprises health management and support staff. The global trend of a migrating health workforce and the improved economies of certain countries influence Ghana\u2019s HRM policy direction over the next five years. (World Health Report, 2006) National Development Goals The national development goals are derived from the vision of the President of Ghana who is mandated to ensure that Ghanaians have access to quality health care. The vision of the President is to lead the country into middle-income status of at least $1000 per capita by 2015. Three main pillars supporting this vision are: \u2022 good governance; \u2022 promotion of the private sector; and \u2022 human resource development. These pillars seek to increase and sustain economic growth and poverty reduction, which underpin the Government\u2019s strategy for wealth and employment creation, as outlined in the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy II (GPRSII). The health sector\u2019s contributing role is to make people in Ghana healthy. This also constitutes a framework for HRM policy direction over the next five years. Health Sector Vision, Mission and Objectives The MOH is responsible for improving the health status and reducing inequalities in health outcomes of all people living in the country through the development and promotion of proactive policies aimed at providing quality and affordable health services through its agencies. The MOH\u2019s mission is to \u201cwork in collaboration with all parties in the health sector to ensure good health and vitality and equitable access to quality health care services for all people living anywhere in Ghana\u201d. The objectives of the sector are: \u2022 To promote healthy lifestyles and reduce risk factors that arise from environmental, economic, social and behavioural causes; \u2022 To ensure equitable access to good quality and affordable health services that improve"}

The MOH seeks to promote healthy living, prevent disease and provide quality health care to those who need it. The MOH is responsible for setting standards for quality health care delivery through its regulatory bodies and seeks to mobilize resources for the implementation of programs in the sector. In conjunction with the Ministry of Education and the private sector, the MOH conducts training (pre-service) to prepare health professionals to be able to practice in Ghana. Effective health care delivery requires public-private sector collaboration. It is in this regard that the MOH encourages private sector participation in the training of health professionals and the delivery of health care to the people of Ghana. Five-year Health Sector Goals The five-year health sector goals are built around the Minister of Health\u2019s vision of wealth creation through provision of quality health care to the people of Ghana. This paradigm shift is focused on promotion and prevention of health in its totality and is aimed at escalating outcomes of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The new paradigm aims at promoting healthy lifestyles, healthy eating and a healthy environment. This will ensure that people remain healthy, diseases and injuries are prevented, and people affected with diseases are restored and rehabilitated. This will reduce costs on the health care system and increase productivity, thereby enhancing national economic growth. HRH \u2013 Vision and Goals The overall goal of"}

The HRM policy is being driven by changes in the health sector policy. The following are the HRM policy measures for the next five years: \u2022 Increase the production and recruitment of health workers focusing on mid-level staff; \u2022 Retain, distribute equitably and increase productivity of health workers by strengthening supervision, refining compensation and incentive schemes, and enhancing legislation and regulation; \u2022 Advocate and mobilize other professionals related to health care to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of health; and \u2022 Empower environmental health inspectors to enforce standards for environmental hygiene. Purpose This document outlines the current situation in relation to HRH in Ghana and defines the goals to be achieved by 2011 through the health sector\u2019s policy direction and national development goals. Based on an analysis of the gap between these goals and the current situation, this document lays down the strategies that are to be pursued over the period 2007-2011 to ensure that sufficient human resources are available and effectively managed and utilized to enable the health sector to achieve its service delivery goals. This document provides a framework for the agencies involved in the provision of health services to follow as a road map, outlining the actions they need to take to contribute to the achievement of the national HRH goals. These agencies include the: \u2022 Ghana Health Service (GHS); \u2022 teaching hospitals; 3 \u2022 Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG); \u2022 Islamic health institutions; \u2022 quasi-government health institutions; \u2022 traditional herbal practitioners; \u2022 regulatory bodies; \u2022 training institutions; and"}

Development Process In October 2005, a forum on Human Resources for Health was conducted. The Minister of Health mandated a technical team to transpose the forum\u2019s recommendations into a human resources policy that would guide the recommendations\u2019 implementation. The technical team brought together representatives from the various agencies that contribute to the planning, training and management of HRH at a series of meetings. This document is the result of those meetings. Thus, this document builds upon the knowledge and experience of a wide array of stakeholders and it is intended that all agencies will accept the results as a common framework for action over the next five years. 4 Situation Analysis Population of Ghana The population of Ghana is presented in Table 1, based on the 2000 national population census. Currently, Ghana\u2019s population stands at 21.8 million and is expected to grow by 2.4% each year. Using this growth rate and applying it equally to each region, Table 1 shows that by 2011 the total population of Ghana will have increased to 24.5 million.

The private, self-financing sector, however, employs 10% of Ghana\u2019s health workforce, mostly in urban areas. The private sector has a large number of health facilities, as indicated in Figure 1. Regardless, they appear to have a proportionately smaller number of staff than the public sector. Most of the data gathered on the private sector was through a census conducted with the support of DANIDA in 2001. This data revealed that there were more practitioners and facilities than were known to exist from previous studies. There has been no update since 2001. A sampling of private practitioners in Accra (SPMDP, 2001) showed their average age to be 60 years. This presents a crisis on the horizon for the private health sector\u2019s human resources. c) Public \u2013 Mission Table 27 in Annex 1 shows that mission hospital and clinic staff are mostly semi-skilled, with auxiliary and ward assistants representing over 50% of employees. Mission institutions are predominantly located in semi-rural areas. In the past, even though the Islamic mission has been providing health care, their contribution had not been captured in health data for the MOH. This document addresses that issue.

Again, in 2004, 10.5 billion cedis was paid to health workers in 55 deprived districts from the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) inflows. However this incentive scheme was not implemented in 2005 due to difficulty in accessing funds from HIPC inflows, thus, raising doubts about the scheme\u2019s sustainability. The MOH has therefore to reconsider ways of accessing funds for this scheme by incorporating the deprived area incentive (DAI) budget into the annual service budget of the sector. Additional Duty Hour Allowance as a Retention Strategy and Its Implications on the Wage Bill One retention strategy was the payment of additional duty hour allowance (ADHA) to health workers. However, as indicated in Table 8, above, and Figure 6, below, the ADHA became the main driver of the escalating wage bill in the health sector. The health worker productivity mapping (2006) indicates that the ADHA payments and salaries in 2005 accounted for 97% of total Government health expenditure and 67% of total Government and donor health expenditure.

One such measure has been the extension of house-jobs from one year to two years for medical and dental officers. The first year is designed to take place in teaching hospitals and the second year in accredited regional and district health facilities. This policy aims at addressing the issue with skilled competencies and redistribution of staff. However, it has not been fully implemented due to poor coordination. The MOH\u2019s policy on increasing production of health workers has seen implementation difficulties. There has been the expansion of all existing health training institutions and the setting up of new institutions and programs as indicated in Table 10, below. Even though efforts have been made to expand the training institutions, much more needs to be done in terms of infrastructure to meet the increasing intake. Table 10: Establishment of New Health Training Courses and Institutions The last five years has seen the establishment of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons and five general nursing schools. New programs have been introduced for direct entry into midwifery and health assistant (clinical) courses as well as a diploma in community health nursing. The MOH has established a total of 21 training institutions and programs over the last five years, some in new health training institutions and others in previously existing institutions. CHAG and the private sector together have opened seven new schools in general nursing and health assistants (clinical). The policy of the MOH to increase the number of graduates together with strengthening capacities in most of the health training institutions has resulted in a 50% increase in admissions into health training institutions and a 20% increase in all admissions into universities since 2001.

There has been stagnation in enrolment in the medical assistants\u2019 program as indicated in Figure 10, below. There is a clear indication that the current medical assistants\u2019 program is not attractive to nurses and the numbers applying have been dwindling since 2000.

The problem is whether to place graduates in the formal sector or the informal sector and also how to integrate their work with orthodox practitioners.

In-service Training The GHS and the teaching hospitals have developed in-service training policies, which have been in place for several years. The policies spell out the training needs, frequency of training and areas of training, with respective curricula and credit points for career progression. Private institutions are expected to adopt the in-service training policies of the GHS. Various professional regulatory bodies have continuing professional education programs for their professional staff to enable them to renew their licenses to practice. Funding of in-service training has been from the annual budgetary allocations to the agencies and institutions. Development partners, including USAID, JICA, Population Council, Quality Health Partners, World Health Organization and DANIDA, have provided both technical and financial support for in-service training. There are no formal strategies for distributing graduates from the medical schools, College of Health and Sciences, or health training institutions.

Occupational Health and Safety The development of health and safety issues in the health sector is currently at the rudimentary level. Challenges include inadequate supplies and the use of obsolete equipment that prevent staff from effectively performing. Leadership and Supervision Leadership in this context refers to the capacity at all levels of policy and service delivery to provide direction, align people, mobilize resources and attain goals. HRH leadership, at both national and agency levels, has been able to provide direction and mobilize resources though not adequately. Much, however, has been achieved in the area of professional association strengthening. HRH leadership has been able to identify and select champions and advocates, hence the introduction of a new salary structure for health workers and the formation of a HRH task group. However, HRH leadership at all levels has not been able to improve capacity for multi-sector and sector-wide collaboration. There are weak institutional capacities for effective supervision and monitoring at all levels of service delivery. Staff Performance and Management There is a staff performance appraisal system that is coordinated by the Office of Head of Civil Service. This system has become an ineffective tool for management because staff at all levels is mostly appraised only when due for promotion. Both hard working staff and poor performers are all graded \u201csatisfactory\u201d. The GHS has recently made efforts to develop their own performance appraisal system although it is still in a trial stage. Other agencies have yet to develop appraisal systems. HRH Retention Over the last five years the MOH has instituted measures to attract and retain health workers in"}

These measures include; \u2022 provision of high purchase saloon cars; \u2022 a tax waiver for imported saloon cars; \u2022 provision of housing schemes for health workers; \u2022 continuing professional development; \u2022 payment of additional duty hour allowance (which was recently abolished); \u2022 establishment of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons for postgraduate training of medical officers; \u2022 consolidated salary; and \u2022 improved human resource management practices in recruitment, placement, redeployment and promotions. The strategy to institute a housing scheme for health workers has not been fully implemented. Some agencies secured lands for their staff to be developed on an individual basis. The revolving fund for the hire purchase vehicles was initiated in 2004 and to date 1,082 saloon cars have been distributed to health workers. The breakdown of distribution is demonstrated in Figure 12, below. 17 Figure 12: Hire Purchase Vehicles Figure 13: Hire Purchase Vehicles by Category of Staff \u201cBrain Gain\u201d Project The MOH in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Migration for International Development Agency (MIDA) started the Brain Gain project in 2005. The project, which is being piloted for three years, is sponsored by the Netherlands\u2019 government and is scheduled to end in 2007. The project provides Ghanaian health professionals resident in Europe the opportunity to work on a short-term basis in Ghana during their vacation periods. In 2005, two medical officers based in the United Kingdom were engaged in CHAG institutions and four lecturers were engaged at the University of Ghana Medical School. There have been encouraging reports on the performance and conduct of the professionals and the MOH hopes to scale up the numbers in subsequent years.

The workforce goal is aimed at getting the \u201cright workers with the right skills in the right place doing the right things\u201d (WHO, World Global Report, 2006). Emphasis is on producing adequate numbers, retaining them, and periodically updating their skills to respond to health situations and future challenges. The development of the policies and strategies in this document centre on a critical analysis of the global health worker situation, national development goals and the policy direction of the health sector. It also focuses on human resource challenges in Ghana, impact of the existing human resource polices and WHO models on health worker productivity. This is aimed at ensuring health worker availability, competence and skill development, responsiveness to emerging challenges, and higher productivity. Key Policy Questions Critical analysis of the challenges has led to the following key policy questions. \u2022 How does the health sector ensure more equitable distribution and skill mix of health staff at different levels of care and geographical locations? \u2022 What can the health sector do to retain trained health professionals? \u2022 How does the health sector address HRH gaps with nonprofessional health workers? \u2022 What are the HRH requirements for meeting the MDGs for health? \u2022 What can the health sector"}

Six underlying principles that uphold the human resource policies for the five-year term are as follows: 1. Improving access to quality health care through rational production and equitable distribution of health personnel; 2. Focusing on health promotion, prevention of disease and regenerative health; 3. Using human resources to achieve the MDGs for health; 4. Providing equal opportunities in training, recruitment and deployment; 5. Creating an enabling environment for health personnel to"}

The development of the mid-level health care cadre has been identified as the priority policy intervention to focus on within the short to medium term. It is known that the production of mid-level cadres will ensure adequate skill mix, reduce the wage bill of the health sector and ensure higher productivity. Operational definition of mid-level cadre: A mid-level cadre is the person trained to support the highly trained health professional and can manage most situations in the absence of the professional. The cadre, however, requires supervision in general. For example: \u2022 Medical assistants \u2022 Clinical assistants \u2022 Community health nurses \u2022 Allied health care assistants \u2022 Environmental health assistants. Operational definition of a professional: Those who have been trained through standardized programs and have been certified by a professional regulatory body. They must have basic entry requirements and have completed a period of training. Role of professional groups All professional groups without regulatory bodies should institute a regulatory body. Professional bodies that are being assisted by mid-level cadres should give proper recognition"}

Further consultations were done to ensure that the recommended interventions were feasible, valid and relevant within the systemic contexts pertaining to the various affected sectors. The resulting NAP reflects stakeholder consensus on evidence-based, context-specific recommendations on multifaceted actions in Ghana including: improving awareness and knowledge of AMR; providing evidence-based knowledge to reduce the burden of AMR; reducing the occurrence of infections in establishments; optimizing the use of antimicrobials in animal and human health; creating an enabling environment for sustainable investment in AMR reduction. The NAP is to be implemented over a five-year period with regular assessments on the progress of implementation, within a multi- stakeholder platform with mutual accountability. An inter-ministerial governing body with the respective Ministers, Chief Directors, Heads of agencies and departments would provide overarching political oversight, whilst an AMR stakeholder/technical platform provides technical direction.

(1) The AMR phenomenon could have far-reaching social, health and economic consequences on several sectors including human health, agriculture, aquaculture, apiculture, as well as the environment. The implication of the above phenomenon on global health has led to several efforts to combat and contain AMR both at global, regional and national levels. Thus, AMR gained attention at the 67th and 68th World Health Assemblies. (2) (3) There have also been efforts at developing National Action Plans for AMR in several countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas, as well as in Africa. Global technical consultative meetings have"}

(4) The World Organisation for Animal Health strategy for combating AMR was released in May 2016. (5) The \u201cOne Health\u201d concept was introduced to communicate the idea that human health and animal health are interconnected and bound to the health of the ecosystems in which they exist (6). It seeks to reiterate an existing concept that animals also share similar susceptibility to some diseases and environmental hazards with humans. This is evident due to the presence and spread of zoonotic diseases including Rabies, Salmonella infection, West Nile virus fever, Q Fever (Coxiella burnetti) and many more. (7) This concept should guide a collaborative approach to appreciate the risks of AMR for human health, animal health and the ecosystem from a global perspective. The one health concept is founded on an awareness of the major opportunities that exist to protect public health through policies aimed at preventing and controlling pathogens within animal populations. All these synergies between animal health, public health and environmental specialists, applied at local, national and global levels will undoubtedly contribute to the constant and simultaneous improvement of public health and animal health worldwide. (8) Founou et al., in their review of antibiotic resistance in the Food Chain from a developing country perspective, concluded that AMR is a global public health challenge with severe health and socio- economics repercussions, and that is significantly influenced by antibiotic use in food animals. Combating AMR effectively at a global scale means addressing it equally in the developed and developing world. Multifaceted, comprehensive and integrated strategies, as advocated by the WHO Global Action Plan and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Action Plan in line with the One Health approach, are urgently required.

The \u201cOne Health\u201d approach is important because, 6 out of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals. (7) Indeed, the OIE Resolution 36 states amongst others that the OIE Strategy on antimicrobials be implemented through a stepwise approach, in close cooperation with WHO and FAO through a One Health approach, as well as with other relevant partners and stakeholders, and that the OIE further promotes inter-sectorial cooperation, coordination and interaction at regional and national levels. It also recommends that the OIE seeks support to enable Member Countries implement the OIE Strategy and their national action plans. (5) Furthermore, it has been recommended that countries follow the WHO, OIE, and FAO recommendations to implement national action plans encompassing human, food, animal, and environmental sectors to improve policies, interventions and activities that page 3 \ufeff \ufeff address the prevention and containment of AMR from farm-to-fork. (9) This national action plan builds on the global agenda and seeks to develop interventions that are evidence-based as well as consensus-driven within the country context in order to maximize the investments in AMR. Situational analysis and assessment WHO reports that, about 440 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis emerge annually, leading to at least 150 000 deaths. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has been reported in 64 countries. It is also reported that, a high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). AMR has become a serious problem for the treatment of gonorrhoea (caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae), involving even \u201clast- line\u201d oral cephalosporins.

The inappropriate and irrational use of antimicrobial medicines provides favourable conditions for resistant microorganisms to emerge, spread and persist. Resistance is also an emerging concern for treatment of HIV infection, after the rapid expansion in access to antiretroviral drugs in recent years. National surveys are underway to detect and monitor resistance. At the end of 2011, more than 8 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries to manage HIV. Although it can be minimized through good programme practices, some amount of resistance to the medications used to manage HIV is expected to emerge. An analysis of data from WHO surveys that target people who have been recently infected with HIV indicates increasing levels of resistance to the Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase (NNRTI) class of anti-retrovirals. This increase is particularly noticeable in Africa, where the prevalence of resistance to NNRTI reached 3.4% (95% CI, 1.8-5.2%) in 2009. (10) Over the past 10 years, antiviral drugs have become important tools for treating epidemic and pandemic influenza. It was estimated that, by 2012, virtually all influenza A viruses circulating in humans would be resistant to drugs frequently used for the prevention of influenza (Amantadine and Rimantadine). Antiviral susceptibility is constantly monitored through the WHO Global Surveillance and Response System. In Africa, antibiotics are among the commonest prescribed medicines. A survey on predictors of antibiotic use in five countries in Africa showed that 90% of individuals with acute illness sought care outside the home with 95% receiving medicines and 36% received antibiotics. Cotrimoxazole, Amoxicillin and Metronidazole represented 75% of the antibiotics received.

This survey also reported various levels of resistance to antibiotics in the sampled countries. (11) (10) Many African countries reported the presence of resistant strains of bacteria. For instance, in Nigeria, there is high resistance to Vancomycin, Gentamycin, Chloramphenicol and Cloxacillin. (12) Various studies carried out proved the existence of antibiotic resistance in Ghana. A study in 2 teaching, 7 regional and 2 district hospitals in Ghana revealed that very common microbes such as streptococci, salmonella, and E. coli showed very high levels of multiple drug resistance, some as high as 78.7%. In the various hospitals sampled, the prevalence of resistance to common and affordable antimicrobials like Tetracycline, Co-trimoxazole, Ampicillin and Nalidixic acid are significantly high (largely above 70%). (11) (13) In another 2007 study carried out in some key health facilities among in-patients and out-patients, specimens taken from various sources including wounds, urine, sputum and blood, showed a high prevalence of MRSA. (11) Furthermore, other evidence in Ghana suggests that, many infectious pathogens are failing to page 4 National Action Plan (NAP) for Antimicrobial Use and Resistance in Ghana respond to common, potent and easily accessible antibiotics in the health system and thus resulting in increased morbidity and mortality from infections. (13) Several reports suggest that antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly global problem; but like with most pandemics, the greatest toll is in the less developed countries. The dismally low rate of discovery of antimicrobials compared to the rate of development of antimicrobial resistance places humanity on the edge of a very dangerous precipice. Since antimicrobial resistance is part of an organism\u2019s natural survival instinct, total eradication might be unachievable; however, it can be reduced to a level that it no longer poses a threat to humanity. While inappropriate antimicrobial consumption contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance,"}

Tackling the menace therefore should go beyond the conventional sensitization of members of the public and occasional press releases to include a multi-sectoral intervention involving the formation of various alliances and partnerships. Involving civil society organisations like the media could greatly enhance the success of the interventions. The mechanism for the surveillance of antimicrobial use and resistance is nascent. Meanwhile, surveillance data of antimicrobial resistance is required to track changes in microbial populations, detect early resistant strains and support the prompt notification and investigation of outbreaks, guide clinical therapy decisions and policy recommendations as well as assess the impact of resistance containment interventions. However, national surveillance systems exist for special public health programmes, e.g. TB and HIV. The TB surveillance system is paper-based (an electronic recording and reporting case- based surveillance system is not yet in place) and aligns with the WHO-recommended structure of quarterly reporting of aggregated data. The system covers health facilities in 170 districts in 10 regions. The 2013 assessment also reveals that there is ongoing deployment of software for transition to such an electronic system. Some data quality elements include: standardization and consistency of the electronic system with international standard (i.e. WHO), scheduled and adequate periodic data submissions (reporting) received and processed at national level, data accuracy, completeness, and internal and external data consistency. (14) The absence of national antimicrobial use policy that guides the use and control of antimicrobials has also contributed immensely to the upsurge in abuse of antimicrobials at community and institutional levels across the country. The use of antibiotics for disease prevention and growth promotion in animal husbandry, and the existence of antibiotic residues in the food chain are also likely to compound the problem of antibiotic resistance.

It is also used in sub-therapeutic doses in livestock feeds to enhance growth and improve feed efficiency in intensive livestock farming. The non-therapeutic use of antimicrobials in livestock production has increased tremendously. The Union of Concerned Scientists report that about 90% of antimicrobials used in the USA were for non-therapeutic purposes. (17) (18) The types of antibiotics used by 110 pig farms in the Ashanti region and the handling practices of the farmers during disease management have been assessed. This study revealed that injectable Tetracycline, Sulphadimidine, Benzylpenicillin, and Dihydrostreptomycin containing antibiotics were overly used by the farmers especially in the management of diarrhea, rashes, and coughs. The study also revealed unsafe storage and disposal practices for these medicines among the farms in Ghana. (19) Misdiagnosis and inadequate protection during antibiotic handling in the farms increased the risk of antibiotic resistance development and spread. The factors affecting antibiotic resistance development and spread are rife in pig farms in the Ashanti region and appropriate education and veterinary interventions are needed to prevent resistant bacteria from becoming endemic in pork and pig farm communities. This is in line with other studies which confirm the use of Tetracycline, Penicillin and Erythromycin in animals for non- therapeutic purposes. (20) The above discovery compounds the risk of AMR development especially for such antibiotics, which are also used in humans.

Meanwhile the veterinary services are poorly resourced with outlets poorly distributed in the country. Public knowledge on veterinary services is also minimal. Collaboration is mainly in the area of zoonotic diseases and not on antimicrobial resistance. (21) The FDA is responsible for the registration, post market surveillance and quality assurance of all medicines including those used in veterinary services. The FDA also regulates imports of antibiotics for veterinary use (22). Meanwhile, antibiotic resistance has not been a priority for veterinary services in Ghana. There are no acceptable national standards regarding antibiotic residue in veterinary and aquaculture produce, the minimum allowable weaning period before slaughter and processing, and no testing for antibiotic residue is done. A case study from Ghana on the presence of beta Lactamase producing Escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates as well as tetracycline residues in chicken meat established the occurrence of drug resistance among E.coli and K. pneumoniae strains isolated from chicken meats bought in Ghana. In addition, high incidence of tetracycline residues was found in chicken meat samples. (23) Another study on the presence of antimicrobials and resistance in healthy subjects from Greater Accra concluded that 74.2% of studied subjects showed the presence of at least one antibiotic residue in their urine, although all (100%) of the study participants had not knowingly consumed antibiotics during the study period. This calls for further investigation as it possible that, people are consuming antibiotics from alternate sources such as food and water. (24) There is anecdotal information on the use of antibiotics in aquaculture especially in fish farming. There is no department/unit responsible for antibiotic use and surveillance in aquaculture as well as the monitoring of residual antibiotics in fish. Some antibiotics used locally in both humans and animals include: tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin. It is imperative"}

This would ensure that the aspirations of national medicines policy are realised. The national action plan on antimicrobial use and resistance therefore seeks to give such interpretation to the new AMR policy for Ghana. page 6 National Action Plan (NAP) for Antimicrobial Use and Resistance in Ghana Country response The AMR policy has been developed to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education and training. It seeks to strengthen knowledge and evidence base through national surveillance and research and improvement of laboratory services for culture and sensitivity. It also seeks to reduce the incidence of infections through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures. It is expected that the use of antimicrobial agents in humans and animal health would be optimized in the \u2018One Health\u2019 approach through specific interventions in the Responsible Use of Antimicrobials in humans, veterinary and aquaculture as well as in the environment and industry. The policy also recommends specific interventions in regulations and enforcement, manufacturing and supply chain, borrowing from existing synergies within the health sector for sustainable investment that considers the needs of all sectors, and increases investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions. It is emphasized that a strong multi-stakeholder collaboration, which has made the development of this policy a success, would also strengthen the implementation of this policy under existing governance structures. In summary, a systemic balance between access and excess is sought through optimal implementation of the AMR policy to preserve antimicrobials for current and future generations.

The elements of the NAP were adapted from the global plan and presented to a group of purposefully selected technical officials within the various sectors of implementation. Local data on ongoing interventions were collected from technical informants in the various areas of work. These were analysed using the policy framework provided by the AMR policy document. Thus interventions were developed to address gaps in all 5 objectives of the global action plan. Further consultations were conducted to ensure that the recommended interventions were feasible and relevant within the systemic contexts pertaining to the various affected sectors.

The strategies for achieving this growth are to improve human capital, to further strengthen the role of the private sector in the development of the economy, and to provide good governance. The strategic direction of improving human capital makes health central to Ghana\u2019s development efforts: only a healthy population can bring about improved productivity and subsequent increase in GDP, and by doing so ensure economic growth. Hence the old adage \u201ca healthy population is a wealthy population\u201d. The mission of the Ministry of Health as stated in the policy document is to contribute to socio-economic development and wealth creation by promoting health and vitality, ensuring access to quality health, population and nutrition services for all people living in Ghana and promoting the development of a local health industry. This mission puts the concept of health beyond the confines of curative care to other socio-economic determinants of health. In fact, the poor environmental conditions in which Ghanaians live, work and go to school has a major impact on their wellbeing. The poor air, water and soil quality in the country is mainly due to improper disposal of waste, emission of dangerous gases from industries and vehicles, and smoke from burning of waste and bush fires. Despite this situation, the measures for controlling these problems have not been effective. Infrastructure for waste management has not kept pace with the population growth. Only a third of the waste produced in the urban centres is collected leaving the rest to pollute the environment. Access to potable water is also a problem. Less than half of the population in the country has access to potable water, leaving the rest"}

Thus our poor lifestyle, Creating Wealth through Health 9 together with known environmental factors, most of which are preventable, manifest in a high level of morbidity and mortality in the country. The majority of conditions leading to out-patient attendance at clinics in Ghana are malaria, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, skin disease, accidents, hypertension, eye infection, pregnancy-related conditions, helminthiasis and osteoarthropathy. Over 90% of these diseases and conditions could easily be prevented if appropriate environmental and lifestyle measures were to be taken. The programmes and projects of the Ministry of Health to date, however, have focused on curative care, leading to failures of the Ministry to make a significant impact in the development of promotive and preventive health to the benefit of its people. It is within this context that this new health policy is being proposed. The policy views health in its broadest sense as a multi-sectoral programme focusing on the physical, social, economic, and spiritual dimensions which can bring total health to individuals, their families and communities. There is therefore a paradigm shift from curative action to health promotion and the prevention of ill-health. The policy argues that a healthy population can only be achieved if there are: improvements in environmental hygiene and sanitation proper housing and town planning provision of safe water provision of safe food and nutrition encouragement of regular physical exercise improvements in personal hygiene immunization of mothers and children prevention of injuries in our work places prevention of road accidents practising of safe sex.

The health of women and children Our Nation\u2019s Wealth Signed MOH Minister 11 1. Introduction T he National Health Policy has been designed within the context of Ghana\u2019s vision of achieving middle income status by 2015. It places health at the centre of socio-economic development and presents a clear shift in the role of health in the national and international development framework. This is based on the recognition that health is not only a human right issue, but also a key driver of development, and ultimately of wealth creation. The theme of the Health Policy is \u201cCreating Wealth through Health\u201d. This conceptualization is not new. Linkages between poverty and health have been amply demonstrated in the Millennium Declaration, the Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, The Ghana Macroeconomics and Health Initiative (GMHI) Report 2005 and the various health sector policies and strategies. What is being brought to bear in this policy is a renewed emphasis on: The significant benefits that this country stands to derive from greater investments in health and nutrition. The critical role that healthy lifestyles, a health-enhancing environment, a vibrant health industry and other sectors beyond health care services play in improving health and socio-economic development. \u2022"}
{"source_file": "NATIONAL-HEALTH-POLICY.pdf", "chunk_id": "NATIONAL-HEALTH-POLICY_5", "text": "\u2022 National Health Policy 12 The Policy adopts an approach that addresses the broader determinants of health. It focuses on the promotion of healthy lifestyles through good nutrition, regular physical exercise, recreation, rest and personal hygiene. The Policy further places healthy lifestyles within the context of the physical and social environments where people live, go to school and work; emphasizing potable water, sanitation, and safe food, housing and roads, as means of promoting good health and prevention of diseases and injury. The Policy seeks to build a pluralistic health service that recognizes allopathic, traditional and alternative providers (both private and public). It also ensures access to quality health interventions for preventing disease and injuries, as well as for restoring the health of the sick and disabled. In that regard, the Policy aims to provide comprehensive health care services comprising preventive, curative and rehabilitative services. Finally, the Policy seeks to promote a vibrant local health industry that supports effective, efficient, and sustainable service delivery, creates jobs and contributes directly to wealth creation and attainment of national development objectives. This Policy provides broad guidelines for the development of programmes by key stakeholders, namely Government, other Ministries Department and Agencies (MDAs), local authorities, such as district assemblies, the private sector, civil society organizations as well as communities and traditional leaders. It is also intended to guide health-enhancing actions of individuals, households and communities and corporate entities. Background This Policy places the national efforts within the global context for health development and aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic framework that builds on progress made in previous years.

The Ministry of Health has been established to assure good health in Ghana and to reduce the impact of ill-health on socio-economic development. Creating Wealth through Health 13 Over the past decades, Government and development partners have sought in various ways to provide the necessary environment and inputs towards improving health service delivery. A Medium Term Health Strategy (MTHS) document and a 5-Year Programme of Work (5YPOW) guided health development in Ghana from 1997 to 2001. Currently the health sector is implementing a second 5-Year Programme of Work (2002\u20132006). This 5YPOW links health more closely to poverty reduction through the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS). It recognizes that improving the health of the poor is crucial to achieving accelerated and sustainable growth. The strategic objectives of the 5YPOW are shown in box 1. Box 1: The Strategic Objectives of the Five Year Programme of Work 2002 \u2013 2006 To increase geographical and financial access to basic services To ensure better quality of care in all health facilities and during outreaches To improve efficiency in the health sector To foster closer collaboration and partnership between the health sector and communities, other sectors and private providers both allopathic and traditional To increase overall resources in the health sector, equitably and efficiently distributed. < < < < < Although the strategic objectives of the 5YPOW and related conceptual framework guiding health sector development recognized the need for inter-sectoral action, actual implementation focused on delivery of health care services.

Similarly, inadequate attention has been given to the rehabilitation of the disabled. Even in the area of medical care, the focus has been on allopathic services, and to a more limited extent on the development of traditional medicine. Very little attention has been given to alternative medicines, even though Ghanaians continue to use those services. Finally, there has never been a strategic approach to developing a local health industry to support health services and contribute to economic development.

The policies of one country affect another country. This has turned the world into a complex entity of dependent and interdependent individuals, groups and countries. National and local decisions on health and development are affected as never before by global forces and policies. The global approach to health and development is increasingly influenced by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is increasing global consensus that countries such as Ghana need to scale up investments and activities towards achieving the MDGs. Achieving the MDGs require that countries look beyond the traditional health system, and address the broader determinants of ill health \u2013 low levels of education, poverty, unequal gender relations, high risk behaviours and unhealthy environment \u2013 as well as Box 2: Principles of Primary Health Care Political Will Intersectoral collaboration Community participation Appropriate technology < < < < We provide wealth to create health Creating Wealth through Health 15 raising the profile of health within national poverty reduction and Government reform processes.

Situation Analysis G hana experienced tremendous gains in health from the immediate post- independence era. Life expectancy improved over the years; smallpox has been eradicated; the prevention of a range of communicable diseases such as measles, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria has improved child survival and development. These gains have been due to advances in science, technology and medicine. Expanded health services based on the principles of primary health care, as well as progress in education and socio-economic development, have also contributed to the gains. However, in the last decade, the pace of health development has stagnated. There has been no significant change in Ghana\u2019s under-five and infant mortality rates between 1993 and 2003. Life expectancy has also stagnated between 57.42 years in 2000 and 56 years in 2005\u0004. Ghana\u2019s human development index (HDI)\u0004 is also worsening. After improving from 0.444 in 1975 to 0.563 in 2001, the HDI dropped to 0.520 in 2005\u0004. A combination of factors such as changing lifestyles and environments, and challenges in the health system may be contributing to the stagnating health and development indicators.

There has also been an increase in the proportion of the elderly above 65 years from 3.2% in 1960 to 5.3% in 2000. The ratio of males to females has also declined from 102.2:100 in 1960 to 97.9:100 in 2000 with a result that there are now more females than males.

Urbanization has the potential to contribute to improvements in quality of life and access to health services. However, the uncontrolled urbanization in the country is negatively affecting the environment in which people live, go to school and work. This is because the pace of urbanization has outstripped the pace of development of social services and infrastructure required to meet the people\u2019s needs. Concurrently, uncontrolled urbanization is leading to the creation of slums, overcrowding, poor housing, inadequate water supply and poor environmental sanitation, with detrimental effects on quality of life and outbreak of infectious diseases. Urbanization is also leading to changes in family structure and living arrangements, eroding traditional values and disrupting social support systems. Urban life erodes health long with wealth.

Access to an adequate supply of potable water for domestic consumption is a major challenge in the country. The coverage of urban water supply in 2002 was 59%, while that for rural areas was 41% as at end of 2000. The coverage of sanitation in the country is even lower. As at 2001 the coverage of sanitation in the country was 12.61%, which is reflected in the frequent sight of persons relieving themselves in public places, often near water sources, with the associated environmental degradation. A safe and healthy work environment is necessary for improved productivity. Currently there is no occupational health and safety policy or guideline to protect the health of workers.

Between 1991/1992 and 1998/1999, the proportion of Ghanaians in extreme poverty declined from 37 per cent to 27 per cent. However, considerable poverty still exists in some areas and pockets in the country. For instance eight out of ten persons in the three northern regions are poor and pockets of extreme poverty exist in the regions and in urban areas. Poverty is a major cause of under-nutrition and ill health. It exacerbates the spread of diseases and reduces productivity. It undercuts the effectiveness of health services and slows population control. Indeed, health suffers most in situations where economies have been unable to secure adequate income levels for all, where social systems have collapsed and where environmental resources have been poorly managed. The poor experience a disproportionate share of ill health in the country. They often live in unsafe and over-crowded housing; they are more likely to be exposed to pollution and other health risks at work and in their communities.

Diseases such as Buruli ulcer, Guinea worm, trachoma and leishmaniasis almost exclusively affect the poor.

Currently, access to allopathic health services is estimated to be about 35% of the population. The remaining 65% of the population use traditional and alternative medical care. Yet this component of health services is not adequately regulated or fully integrated into the existing health service delivery system. The factors responsible for the poor geographic access include inadequate investments in health facilities relative to need, hard-to-reach communities, sub-optimal spatial distribution of health facilities and lack of communication National Health Policy 26 equipment. Other barriers to health services are financial, organization of service delivery and broad socio-cultural barriers, including gender. The different roles and responsibilities of men and women, inequalities in access to resources and lack of information are reflected in their health-seeking behaviours and subsequent vulnerability to illness and quality of care available to them. Rehabilitative services have been less well developed in spite of the relatively high prevalence of disability, currently estimated to be 2 million, in the country. A quality assurance programme aimed at improving the quality of health services is also being implemented. However, the quality of health service is constrained by absence of comprehensive standards and norms, weak organizational and management capacity, weak support systems such as transportation and equipment for service delivery, inadequate numbers and poor distribution of human resources.

The coverage of NHIS has been increasing steadily.

However health financing is still a major challenge. The increase in funding to the health sector has gone mainly into the payment of personal emoluments rather than to support service delivery.

The current approach to resource allocation and purchasing fails to define clearly what is purchased.

Ghana is receiving general budget support for the implementation of GPRS through the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) facility anchored in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

At the same time, the NHIS has been established to replace user fees for services. Looking ahead, the major resources of the sector will mainly consist of GOG and NHIS funding.

Health Information Systems Health system governance depends on the availability of quality, relevant and timely information and knowledge. Health information provides the information support to the decision-making process at all levels of the health system. Health information is particularly important for resource allocation and public health action in countries such as Ghana, where resources are limited: unwise allocation of resources can lead to wastage and the difference between survival and death.

Governance And Partnerships Governance and partnerships are important for the effective functioning of the health system and for achieving health sector objectives. The governance arrangements include: institutions and their organizational structures managerial processes including policy formulation, priority setting, resource allocation, planning, monitoring and evaluation coordination mechanisms performance assessment and accountability regulation. The legal framework for health delivery defines the mandates of agencies; governance processes ensure that agencies deliver on their mandates and contribute to the achievement of the health sector objectives.

The only treatment for hypoxemia is medical oxygen therapy. Medical oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen therapy, is the use of inhaled oxygen as an essential medicine in medical treatment. The purpose of supplying additional oxygen is to eliminate hypoxemia that may lead to tissue hypoxia and death. Oxygen supplementary treatment works by increasing oxygen content in the blood in patients with low levels of oxygen in the blood, in an attempt to oxygenate the vital organs in the body and avoid tissue hypoxia and death.

Pneumonia is a major cause of hypoxaemia leading to death among all age groups. Pneumonia resulted in 1.4 million deaths globally among all age groups in 2010 (7% of the world\u2019s yearly total) and 3.0 million deaths in 2016 (the 4th leading cause of death in the world[1][2]. In 2015, pneumonia was responsible for the deaths of 473,000 African children under the age of five years old.[5] In Sub- Saharan Africa, there are an estimated four million cases and 200,000 deaths in adult populations per year.[3] . It is estimated that 20\u201340% of these deaths could be prevented with the availability of oxygen therapy[4]. Oxygen is used across all levels of the healthcare; it is essential in safe surgery, anaesthesia, obstetric, and emergency care, within several units of the health system including Neonatal (New-Born) Intensive Care Units (NICU), Paediatric Units, General wards, Emergency transport (Ambulance), Delivery Units, and Intensive Care Units (ICUs).

It has accelerated global demand for medical oxygen by 3-7 folds and made the delivery of oxygen supplies more urgent than ever.5 Ghana still faces a high burden of deaths due to lack of access to oxygen. Despite numerous World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines emphasising the importance of oxygen across the continuum of care, availability and supply of medical oxygen to patients have been inadequate, especially to those who need it most. 1.0 CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION Strategic Action Plan 2 Specific barriers to availability and supply of oxygen resources in Ghana include limited production capacity, inefficient logistics management (especially transportation), limited oxygen cylinders and high production cost. Additionally, an erratic payment system, inadequate human resources capacity (for use, maintenance, and management), inadequate technical training, poor quality and unreliable power supply, high electricity tariffs, erratic supply chain systems and logistics, few medical oxygen-producing plants, and poor maintenance including spare parts availability compound the issues. Additionally, the availability of medical oxygen in public and private health facilities as well as pre-hospital care services, highly depends on a facility\u2019s geographic location and their proximity to oxygen generation sources. In urban centres and high -population regions, medical oxygen is more readily available whereas in remote areas, supply chain and logistical challenges along with infrastructural limitations (e.g., electricity availability and road network) limit access to medical oxygen. There is therefore the need to address the availability of oxygen delivery and monitoring devices as vital health commodities and as part of the measures to scale up medical oxygen access and use in the country. To mitigate these aforementioned challenges, there have been multiple initiatives by the Ministry of Health, its Agencies and Partners, the Private"}

Oxygen concentrators and cylinders remain the most common modalities of oxygen provision to patients in Ghana. Despite these efforts, most health facilities and ambulances in the country have limited availability of a continuous source of medical oxygen. It is therefore appropriate that the Ministry of Health ensures that medical oxygen production and access is adequately funded, always available and captured in health plans and budgets.

In summary, the ability to quickly detect and treat hypoxemia is critical to patient care. After the declaration of the novel COVID-19 as a pandemic by the President of the Republic of Ghana in March 2020, Ghana experienced three waves of COVID-19 infections within 18 months: from May to August 2020, and again from January to March 2021, then July to September 2021. The second and third waves were characterized by an increase in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 infections. This led to increase in demand for medical oxygen therapy. 6 DHIMS 2 data for 2020 7 Mercy Abbey, Seth Kwaku Afagbedzi, Jane Afriyie-Mensah, David Antwi-Agyei, Kirchuffs Atengble, Ebenezer Badoe, James Batchelor, Eric S Donkor, Reuben Esena, Bamenla Q Goka, Michael G Head, Appiah-Korang Labi, Edmund Nartey, Isabella Sagoe-Moses, Edem M A Tette, Pneumonia in Ghana\u2014a need to raise the profile, International Health, Volume 10, Issue 1, January 2018, Pages 4\u20137, https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihx062 8 Duke T et al.

In line with the country\u2019s Strategic Response Plan for COVID-19, which aimed to: contain the virus; slow down and manage community spread; provide medical and psychosocial care for COVID-19 cases; and minimize the impact on social and economic life, it was imperative for Ghana to adequately prepare for a surge. The country\u2019s experience during the second and third waves illustrated the growing demand for therapeutics, including medical oxygen. Limited access to and use of effective diagnostic tools and medical oxygen for diagnosis, treatment and management of hypoxemia, as well as the absence of supportive clinical governance and equipment maintenance systems, were prevalent in Ghana. Diagnostic tools such as pulse oximeters, which support the diagnosis of hypoxemia, and monitors the patients\u2019 response to oxygen therapy, were also not readily available.

Generally, the health of the population has improved over the years. Life expectancy has improved from 57 years in 1990 to 64 years in 2017. In the same vein, the Maternal Mortality Ratio dropped to 310 per 100,000 live births in 2017 from 315 per 100,000 in 2007; the Under-5 mortality rate which in 2005 was 72 per 1000 live births, has reduced to 56 per 1000 live births in 2017. These outcome indicators show positive returns on health investments made over the years. However, the impact of COVID-19 on these health indices is yet to be ascertained. Systemic challenges remain, including 1. Inadequate and inequitable distribution of human resources; 2. Inadequate health infrastructure; 3. Inadequate sustainable financing; 4. Lack of comprehensive general data governance and reporting system; 5. Cross-programmatic inefficiencies; 6. Low compliance to regulations and standards; and 7.

Information gathered indicated that twelve (12) of the oxygen producers have stopped production due to several reasons of which high electricity tariff was the major reason. Ten (10) of the remaining fifteen (15) producers in operation were using Cryogenic technology. Among the fifteen (15) active oxygen producers in operation, three (3) were steel production companies whose core mandate was to produce oxygen for refining steel. However, due to the spike in the oxygen demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the steel production companies dedicated some of their oxygen plants to supply health institutions with medical oxygen. These steel production companies supplied oxygen to the health facilities either at no cost or at a subsidized rate. The rest of the commercial oxygen producers supplied oxygen to health facilities at a commercial rate. Air Liquide has been the leading and the longest-serving oxygen production company in Ghana. It was the only liquid oxygen producing company in Ghana and the sub-region. Unfortunately, the company relocated its in-country Cryogenic Liquid Oxygen Production Plant to Nigeria in 2017 due to high electricity tariffs and unstable power supply in Ghana. Currently, the company imports liquid oxygen from Cote D\u2019Ivoire, which is stored in a Vacuum Insulated Evaporator (VIE) tank in its factory and refills cylinders for distribution in Ghana.

Strategic Action Plan 15 Figure 2 - Distribution of Hospital-based PSA oxygen producing plants Other hospitals, polyclinics, health centres, clinics, CHPS Compounds, maternity homes and ambulances rely on cylinders or portable oxygen concentrators for their oxygen needs. They procure their oxygen from the commercial oxygen production plants and transport them to their respective health facilities. With the oxygen production companies primarily located in the major cities in the southern Strategic Action Plan 16 and middle belts, namely, Accra-Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and Kumasi areas, health facilities in the other parts of the country sourcing oxygen from these areas must travel long distances to purchase their oxygen, thus resulting in higher transportation costs. The estimated transportation cost ranges from GH\u20b5 300.00 (equivalent to US$51.28 at the rate of US$1 = GH\u20b55.85 as of 31st August 2021) to GH\u20b5 900.00 (equivalent to US$153.85) per trip depending on location. Several health facilities are confronted with challenges in oxygen access and sufficiency. These challenges include: \u2022 High cost of oxygen producing plants; \u2022 Lack of or inadequate oxygen cylinders; \u2022 High oxygen cylinder transportation cost; \u2022 Lack of funds to guarantee timely payment; \u2022 Non-existent tariff regime for cost recovery for oxygen administered to patients; \u2022 Inconsistent supply/delivery of oxygen by vendors; \u2022 High debt burden from purchases of oxygen; \u2022 Insufficient capacity to maintain oxygen systems; \u2022 Lack of or insufficient oxygen piping network systems coupled with leakages; and \u2022 Increase in demand due to COVID-19 pandemic. All these challenges contribute to frequent stock out and shortages in oxygen supply in many health facilities across the country. 1.2.4 PROCUREMENT LANDSCAPE The responsibility for procuring medical oxygen and related equipment lies primarily with the individual health facilities. Decentralised procurement to this effect makes it difficult to coordinate the"}

For example, hospitals can procure medical oxygen and related equipment independently using their budgets. There is a need for a national guideline with technical specifications to guide procurement practices across the country. Strategic Action Plan 17 There are three types of oxygen production companies in Ghana: 1. Commercial oxygen producers; 2. Steel manufacturers and; 3. Other industrial manufacturers (e.g. mining companies). As of August 2021, steel companies sold their oxygen around GH\u20b55.00 (equivalent to US$0.85) per cubic meter of oxygen whilst the commercial oxygen producers sold their oxygen between GH\u20b510.00(equivalent to US$1.71) to GH\u20b520.00(equivalent to US$3.42) per cubic meter, depending on the technology they use in producing the oxygen. The wide variation in the prices between the steel companies and the commercial oxygen producers is due to the special subsidized electricity tariffs and tax incentives offered to the steel companies, to which the commercial oxygen producers are not entitled. For example, whilst the steel companies pay around 50p/kWh of electricity, the commercial medical oxygen producers pay close to GH\u20b520.00/kWh of electricity. Thus, the pricing of medical oxygen in Ghana is highly influenced by the electricity tariff. In addition to the local production of oxygen, some companies import oxygen for use in Ghana. According to the World Bank, the top exporting countries of medical oxygen into Ghana in 2019 included Cote D\u2019Ivoire, the European Union, and China8.

This has increased the debt burden of health facilities. 1.2.5 FINANCING LANDSCAPE Medical oxygen is captured as essential Medicine on the Ministry of Health\u2019s Seventh Edition, 2017 Essential Medicines List9 but the National Health Insurance Authority does not currently reimburse it as a medicine separately, but rather as bundled charge. Government, as part of the capital investment program, finances the initial set up of the medical oxygen as part of the medical gas systems in some health facilities. It provides assistance for the installation of onsite medical oxygen production plants, installation of the central piping network for distribution of oxygen, provision of oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and related equipment or accessories. On the other hand, facilities are responsible for the maintenance and refilling of the oxygen cylinders using their facility\u2019s Internal Generated Fund (IGF). 9 Ministry of Health, Ghana National Drugs Programme, Essential Medicines List Seventh Edition, 2017 Strategic Action Plan 19 Higher-level facilities including the secondary and tertiary levels are able to finance oxygen supply and undertake oxygen plant and oxygen concentrator maintenance (both planned and corrective) to some extent.

Since the NHIS does not currently reimburse oxygen as a medicine separately, but rather as bundle charges, the facilities are not able to realistically recover the cost of medical oxygen consumed by the patients. This results in insufficient funding for medical oxygen. Also delays in the NHIS reimbursement causes health facilities to be consistently in payment arrears. For example, facilities that rely on oxygen supply in cylinders often face oxygen stock-outs as some suppliers will not refill oxygen cylinders if an account has an outstanding balance. With undue delays, some facilities are denied supply of medical oxygen, which results in stock-outs of oxygen. Similarly, the National Ambulance Service also faces challenges in procuring oxygen from vendors to manage patients during transport. Oxygen for ambulance services delivery is financed by the GoG annual budget allocation, however, the amounts budgeted for are not released on time and are inadequate to support the procurement of oxygen and they are always in arrears. 1.2.6 REGULATORY LANDSCAPE Essential medicines, including medical oxygen, are regulated under sections 111 to 132 of Part Seven of the Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851). Medical oxygen is listed on the Essential Medicines List, 2017. However, enforcement of regulation on medical oxygen systems production and standards are limited. Although medical oxygen is packaged in pressure vessels (cylinders) and could be regulated under the Factories, Offices, and Shops (Boiler and Pressure Vessels) Safety Act, 1970 (Act 663), the Act does not take into consideration medical oxygen cylinders. To regulate medical oxygen cylinders or pressure vessels for medical oxygen, the Act needs to be reviewed.

Health facilities purchase oxygen in cylinders and transport them to their facility. The high cost of oxygen results in an inadequate supply of oxygen in these health facilities. Unfortunately, medical oxygen is an important resource for the survival of patients especially COVID-19 patients and patients in respiratory distress. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, oxygen stock-out in health facilities existed but was not a major issue. With the COVID-19 pandemic, oxygen demand has increased by 3-7 folds. This has worsened the already existing situation and health facilities are challenged with frequent oxygen shortages. Table 5 below, shows the severity of COVID-19 conditions and amount of oxygen demand for effective treatment. The table illustrates that for 75 patients with severe illness (individuals who have SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm Hg, a respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%) and 25 patients with critical COVID-19 illness presentation (individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/ or multiple organ dysfunction), in a hypothetical 100 bed COVID-19 treatment facility, approximately 90m3/hr of oxygen supply would be required.

The challenges are well documented. Weak health systems exacerbated by continuing challenges in developing and retaining the requisite human resource for health have contributed to the current level of performance of the health sector in many developing countries. To overcome these challenges, the need for a faster and e\ufb00ective way to generate knowledge, share knowledge and translate knowledge into e\ufb00ective and a\ufb00ordable interventions and strategies that make health care accessible to the most needy and vulnerable people in our societies is urgently needed. Ghana is struggling to meet the MDGs not because of the lack of solutions to our health problems, but because we lack the resources to apply the tested and well rehearsed interventions where it is needed and in a sustained manner. In almost all instances our inability to acquire and deploy the needed technology remains a formidable barrier. The development of our health infrastructure has lagged behind as a result of continuing poor investments in the health sector. Our inability to invest more in the health sector stems out of many factors which unfortunately have been aggravated by the global economic recession. This has resulted in many communities having to go without basic health services and this contributes signi\ufb01cantly to our overall ability"}

This has been demonstrated in several pilot projects across the developing world. The availability of affordable and easy to use systems and equipment has also contributed to the several initiatives aimed at improving the effectiveness of health care providers, the efficiency of health system managers and new opportunities for health care consumers. Within the last three decades, the demand to intensify the use of Information and Communication Technology has increased.

In the last ten years, the call to developing countries to apply technology to their e\ufb00orts at meeting the MDGs has been made in several quarters. At the Annual Ministerial Review of the United Nations Economic and Social Council held in Accra in June 2009, African countries were called upon to develop comprehensive policies and strategies to guide the uptake of Information and Communication Technology in the health sector. The increasing need to bring technology to bear on health sector performance is shown in other global heath strategies. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 9 The World Health Organization de\ufb01nes e-health as \u2018the combined use of electronic information and communication technology in the health sector.\u2019 In practical terms, health care delivery should begin to take advantage of the opportunities that technology has made available to other sectors, such as commerce and education, to propel the world towards health for all. These opportunities include improvements in technical and management processes that will lead to more e\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective health services in the face of ever growing resource constraints. It also means that health managers and providers will have a better control over resources and ensure optimal health outcomes. The development of a national e-health strategy constitutes the \ufb01rst stage of a long term undertaking aimed at raising the levels of performance of the health sector in all areas of service delivery. It constitutes a framework for engaging consumers of health services and ensuring that they contribute e\ufb00ectively towards raising the overall health status of the population.

Presently the system is straining to deal with increasing cost of service and to respond to increasing pressure to expand services to enable the inequity gap that exists between urban and rural areas, the northern and the southern sectors of the country and between the rich and the poor to be closed. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 10 This demand also comes in the face of persistent de\ufb01cit in health manpower across board. Over the last few years, the Ministry of Health has begun exploring new ways of delivering service in the face of these realities, to improve the outcome of investments being made in the health sector. This has resulted in policies such as the close-to-client policy, free maternal care, review of the premium payment systems to remove existing \ufb01nancial barriers, and the introduction of incentive packages to entice sta\ufb00 to work in deprived areas. Although these policies are yielding some results, these are not enough to guarantee the achievements of the MDGs come 2015. While processes for delivering service remain ine\ufb03cient and unreliable in many respects, management processes are fraught with redundant systems which add no value to transactions and performance continue to be based on data which is not completely reliable. Consumer interactions with the health system continue to be driven by the need to seek treatment for ailments and not for making lifestyle choices. This has resulted in an apparent stagnation of performance in"}

The adoption of e-health solutions presents new opportunities for making progress in the sector performance. It creates the impetus for far reaching changes in the way service is provided. Such change will require a fundamental shift in the way information is accessed and shared across the health system. It also requires a new approach to patient management and the expanded use of the existing knowledge base in the sector to manage health challenges across geographical boundaries. Several review reports have indicated the need for innovation to push performance levels. The continuing human resource challenges, the large wage bill which leaves little resources for actual delivery of service, the stagnation in coverage of key public health services, the continuing and probably worsening of nutritional indicators, the dismal performance in supervised delivery despite high antenatal care coverage, the di\ufb03culty in GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 11 achieving behavioural change targets in sexual and reproductive health despite high levels of awareness are some of the many reasons why the sector must be more innovative in approaching health care delivery and this makes a strong case for serious consideration of e-health solutions. 1.2 Overview of Current Demands for E-Health Solutions The health sector in Ghana is characterized by a large number of di\ufb00erent management units working and generating large amount of information which are held in separate silos. This creates di\ufb03culties in sharing information and has been a key factor in the inability of the sector to e\ufb00ectively demonstrate its performance.

Presently there is an increasing incidence of chronic diseases which is resulting in the need for long term management of chronic diseases. This will lead to a situation where increasing care and treatment maintenance will be delivered in at the community level. There will be the need to support health care providers at that level with the tools they need to access and share relevant health information. There is a persistent challenge of ensuring equitable distribution of health care resources across the country. This has manifested in performance disparities among regions, districts and between rural and urban settings. In many of the deprived areas of the country, there has not been any sustainable strategy to move services to them. Human resource situations are precarious leaving communities to continually take up low level services. The deployment of e-health under such circumstances can have a huge impact on how treatment decisions are made and the outcome of individual encounter with health facilities. The rate at which technology is changing is enormous. Complex and expensive diagnostic equipment now come with information and communication component. Taking advantage of such new capabilities can lead to signi\ufb01cant savings and improved quality of care for patients. It also o\ufb00ers opportunities for research and knowledge management for health care professionals.

Sometimes even well rehearsed procedures to combact emergencies and epidemics are called in too late simple for lack of a well functioning communication system. All these can e\ufb00ectively be minimized through e-health solutions. The demand for e-health solution is amply demonstrated by the number of initiatives being undertaken in several areas of health care delivery. The challenge is that these initiatives are not coordinated, they are not based on existing standards and are tailored for sector wide improvements required to deliver sector goals and targets. Almost all are focused on small components of system-wide challenges and are therefore of little bene\ufb01t in the long run. 1.3 Repositioning E-Health To Meet Health Sector Goals The National Health Policy states that Ghana is currently pursuing three broad health sector objectives. These are: a) To ensure that people live long, healthy and productive lives and reproduce without an increased risk of death b) To reduce the excessive risk and burden of morbidity, mortality and disability, especially in the poor and marginalized groups c) To reduce inequalities in access to health, reproduction and nutrition services and Meeting these objectives require a change in the way health business is run.

This can e\ufb00ectively be done by using Information and Communication Technology. The global challenge of meeting the targets of the MDGs also creates the need for Information and Communication Technology support in the health sector. It has become obvious that as a country, Ghana is struggling to make the level of progress that will lead to the achievement of the MDGs. Child survival interventions and e\ufb00orts at reducing maternal mortality are lagging behind. Fortunately the challenges are well documented. Weak health systems exacerbated by continuing challenges in developing and retaining the requisite human resource for health, lack of access to basic proven interventions and the large burden of endemic diseases coupled with challenges of malnutrition conspire to reverse some of the fragile gains made within the last few years. These are challenges that can be successfully dealt with by taking a radical view of the use of technology in the health sector. To reposition the health sector towards meeting the MDGs, the current and future penetration of Information and Communication Technology must be seen as complementary to existing strategies. Technology holds a lot of promise for making the big strides urgently needed for improving the health of communities, especially those living in rural areas. There is therefore the need to develop policies and legal frameworks for its roll out in the health sector and to minimize the frequent failures usually encountered in the adoption of new technology in the health sector. 2.0 THE HEALTH SECTOR IN GHANA 2.1 The Health Status of Ghanaians In Ghana, the disease pattern has changed very little over the last two decades.

Epidemics of cerebrospinal meningitis, yellow fever and cholera remain a signi\ufb01cant threat. Emerging and re-emerging diseases of increasing magnitude and threat include HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, buruli ulcer and \ufb01lariasis. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, neoplasms and diabetes are emerging threats, whilst trauma and other injuries are the \ufb01fth most common outpatient condition. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 15 GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 16 The six main causes of morbidity and mortality among children have persisted as the main threat to their health over the years. However these have largely been brought under control through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Malaria is still the number one killer among children and acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia; diarrhoea, malnutrition including anaemia; and neonatal causes continue to be major health problems. These \ufb01ve health problems account for about 50% of all childhood admissions and 30% of childhood deaths. The overall morbidity and mortality pattern highlights the linkage between poverty, inequalities and health. Most of this burden results from diseases, such as malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia whose occurrence could be dramatically reduced by low-cost and e\ufb00ective preventive and curative interventions. In other terms, the marginal social and economic returns from investments in health are highest in avoiding these premature deaths. Since communicable diseases in childhood are, in general, more amenable to broad-based primary prevention e\ufb00orts than are non-communicable diseases, their heavy burden re\ufb02ects, among other, the di\ufb03cult living conditions and the inadequacy of the primary health care system. The current mortality pattern has wide policy implications. First, it highlights the persistent burden of childhood communicable diseases, for which preventive measures (such as sanitation and health education) and simple curative measures (such as malaria treatment and oral rehydration) can be delivered e\ufb03ciently through community-based care and outreach services.

GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 17 A double burden of disease is already emerging at the early stage of the epidemiologic transition, with a mix of persistent, new and re-emerging infectious diseases and increasing chronic conditions and injuries. This will lead to fundamental changes in the volume and composition of demand for health care, with a more complex case mix and a more costly service utilization patterns. 2.2 Organization of Health Services in Ghana The health services in Ghana include government health services, private, traditional and nongovernmental providers, civil society, and community groups. It also includes collaboration and partnership with other ministries, departments, and agencies whose policies and services have a major impact on health outcomes. The health services are organized in several tiers ranging from the sub- district to national level. The sub-district level comprises health centres, health posts and clinics. As part of the e\ufb00ort to improve access to health services, the Community-Based Health Planning and Services has been designated as another level of health care delivery which combines public health and basic clinical care activities at the community level. The activities of the sub-districts are coordinated at the district level which would normally have a hospital designated as the \ufb01rst referral point.

National level referral facilities include two teaching hospitals, three psychiatric hospitals and a large military and police hospitals. Government is by no means the only provider of health services in GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 18 Ghana. Other providers include the mission sector, employers, private medical practitioners and an informal sector, comprising traditional practitioners of various kinds as well as pharmacies and chemical sellers of indeterminate size. Mission Health Services have a long and distinguished history in Ghana. This sector operates nearly 20% of hospitals and clinics in Ghana. Public health and preventive services are commonly o\ufb00ered by mission institutions, often in the form of outreach services or satellite clinics. The private for pro\ufb01t sector comprises a variety of providers ranging from the formal hospitals, clinics and diagnostic facilities to the informal drug peddlers. Traditional practitioners are also prevalent and span a multitude of provider types and treatment regimens ranging from traditional birth attendants, herbalists and bone setters to homeopaths and spiritual healers. The Ghana Ambulance Service aims at providing accessible 24-hour ambulance service nationwide through its own ambulance service and by collaborating with other service providers such as the Fire Service and other hospital-based ambulances. The service also provides improved pre-hospital care in accidents, emergencies and disasters. To facilitate such activities, the service generates timely, complete and accurate information for the e\ufb03cient operations of the service and ensures the provision of rapid response for persons involved in accidents, emergencies and disasters. As part of its mandate, the Ghana Ambulance Service promotes \ufb01rst aid training to the public and collaborates with other emergency services in national disaster planning.

The Board also undertakes safety monitoring, post market surveillance and product promotion including allocations of narcotics and psychotropic substances. The Pharmacy Council is charged with the primary responsibility of ensuring the highest standards in the practice of pharmacy in Ghana. This is done by assuring competence of service providers through licensing of personnel and prescribing standards of practice for them. The council also ensures a reliable medicine supply and distribution system and promotes rational use of drugs. Such responsibilities are also executed through licensing of premises, inspections and enforcement of standards through monitoring. The Nurses and Midwives Council focuses on the training of nursing and midwifery personnel for health care delivery. Their key objective is to ensure that there are enough competent nursing and midwifery human resource at every level of the healthcare delivery system, delivering safe and e\ufb03cient care.

These include hospitals, health centres, clinics and maternity homes. While other agencies deal with the human resource, the board ensures that these facilities are manned and function according to standards. The board thus registers and renews the registration of these facilities. The Traditional and Alternate Medicines Council aims at making traditional medicine an integral part of health care delivery in Ghana. The council is responsible for the implementation of the Traditional Medicines Council Law which guides the registration and regulation of practitioners and the sale of traditional medicine products. The Centre for Research into Plant Medicine is a WHO collaborating Centre for Research and Development of Traditional Medicine. Its main business is to conduct and promote scientific research in herbal medicine through its own research activities and by providing technical support to institutions and individual herbalists.

It was noted that over 40 years after independence, disease patterns had changed very GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 21 little, the use of services was low and other determinants of health status were poorly provided.

A Sector-Wide Approach to planning and programming and resource mobilization and disbursement was adopted leading to a dramatic change in the way aid was coordinated. Other steps taken included the strengthening of Primary Health Services at the district level, re-orienting and strengthening secondary and tertiary services in support of the district level and providing national level support through training and management development, policy analysis, development of central support system, promoting private sector involvement and promoting inter-sectoral collaboration. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 22 2.4 Key Health Systems Challenges The factors leading to the poor health status outlined are well documented. The poorly kept and unhygienic environment is implicated in most of the commonly occurring diseases that a\ufb04ict us as a country. The source of most infections and infestations can be traced to the environment and as slums continue to develop particularly in the peri- urban areas. The silent epidemic of non communicable diseases can also be linked directly to the changing life styles of the average Ghanaian which is characterized by poor eating habits and lack of exercise and recreation. The major challenge"}

The health sector continues to su\ufb00er from severe inequities in access to health services resulting in large disparities in health outcomes across regions. Some diseases are also persistent; particularly those that intensify poverty continue to be a challenge. This may largely be due to the continuing poor environmental sanitation at the community level. There is also the increase burden of non communicable diseases as a result of increasing risk factor emanating from unhealthy life styles. Malaria presents a particular challenge as it has vast economic and social e\ufb00ects on the population. Maternal and Child mortality remains very high. Although e\ufb00orts have been made to improve EOC in the health sector, the e\ufb00ort has not translated into the desired reduction in maternal deaths. Weak Referral and poor emergency response systems have been noted as the key areas a\ufb00ecting the implementation of a seamless health service. Improvement in health infrastructure including transport, ICT continues to lag behind the demand for services. With the concept of \u201cclose to client\u201d services, the development of CHPS compound has also remained GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 23 slow. Expansion of health facilities is limited leaving large areas still without basic health services and peri-urban areas remain particularly deprived. Human resource production and distribution and the management of the health sector wage bill are still challenges in ensuring equity in health outcomes. While the health worker to population ratio remains small, the distribution of health workers remains skewed towards urban areas. The increasing wage bill is of particular challenge. Personnel cost is on the increase taking over 90% of government recurrent budget. There are broader issues of a multi sectoral origin that also impinge on health development. Development planning"}

Most health facilities in the country have computing equipment, multimedia device, imaging and printing system, communication and Internet system. The existing ICT infrastructure have not been fully integrated and networked in a manner that will support healthcare services locally or across facilities. Apart from a few hospitals with a fully functional local area network (LAN), most of the healthcare providers have restricted their LANs to the front GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 25 o\ufb03ce and pharmaceutical unit of their facilities. The LANs are mainly used to support the automation of pharmaceutical services and front o\ufb03ce operations like patient registration and records keeping. Multimedia systems are employed for playing back medical and non- medical documentaries and movies at the front desks. Routine planned preventative maintenance is not carried out because of budgetary constraints. Service level agreement is not used to de\ufb01ne the nature and quality of ICT services outsourced. Well-de\ufb01ned e-health architecture is the main pillar for achieving success in any e-health strategy.

Key elements of the patient record in hospitals remain exclusively paper-based. Imaging and diagnostic results are not available electronically and are also not accessible from remote locations. Electronic versions of prescription history are not available and there is no electronic logistics and supply chain management system in place for medicines and non-consumables.

The MOH and a few of the agencies and regulatory bodies have GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 29 developed web sites for the dissemination of information.

These systems collectively drive e-health and provide life saving data and information for clinical and non-clinical use. The key bene\ufb01ts to be achieved through a comprehensive e-Health strategy in Ghana are: \u2022 Improved access and availability of healthcare services in remote or rural areas. Through mobile telephony or telemedicine, health care consumers will reduce the need for travel and referral to a secondary or tertiary health institution. \u2022 Improved quality of care as a result of reduction in wait-times for medical treatment and surgical procedures and enhanced access to data for research.

There are however some barriers to its e\ufb00ective implementation. There are di\ufb00erent stakeholders in the health sector providing services across wide geographic areas. The presence of such a wide range of autonomous providers from both public and private sectors creates a semblance of a fragmented health service. This is especially so with the diverse ownership of the services, some of which have clearly di\ufb00erent ideological basis for their enterprise. This has made it very di\ufb03cult to e\ufb00ectively coordinate and align information systems in the past and will pose a challenge in the implementation of e-health solutions in the future. The e\ufb00ective use of ICT systems for electronic health records, e- prescribing and bar coding of medical and non medical consumables, point of care decision support tools etc require commitment and clear decisions on investments in technology. In a developing country such as Ghana, the priority in the health sector is to invest in direct services such as procurement of drugs, vaccines and medical supplies to \ufb01ght communicable diseases. With continuing constraints in budgetary allocation, most of the e-health solutions will have to be funded either through internally generated funds thus making them small uncoordinated projects, or through donor support. E-health programmes typically require large sustained investment over \ufb01ve to ten year periods which will not be a strategically attractive funding candidate for most donors. The health sector in Ghana su\ufb00ers a shortage of ICT skills required to deliver large scale e-health programs. Given the complexity of workplace and technological challenges"}

The need to nurture such skills and ensure that they are ready for e\ufb00ective implementation of the strategy will create signi\ufb01cant delay in the system. The underlying health information technology infrastructure is weak. This is due to consistent under-investment. In addition the market is crowded with information technology vendors who are only capable of providing basic ICT services. This limits the health sector\u2019s ability to adopt new systems and technologies which have been tested and proven successful in developed countries. One of the key risks is therefore the ability of vendors to deliver robust solutions in a timely manner. This limits the health sector in many ways to implement very small basic solutions and pass them on as solutions that must be adopted. 4.0 THE NATIONAL E-HEALTH VISION Ghana is aspiring to be a middle income country by the year 2015. To achieve this economic status, it is recognized that the country will need the full contribution of its population. Such contribution can only come from a healthy and productive population. With the health sector plagued with persistent challenges which have, for a long time, prevented the attainment of sector goals and objectives, e-health is seen as an additional tool which, when strategically deployed, can help the sector to overcome these challenges and be able to provide people living in Ghana with high quality health services according to the needs of individuals, families and communities. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 33 GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 34 4.1 The Vision E-health will enable the delivery of quality, a\ufb00ordable and up-to-date health services in an equitable and timely manner by enhancing communication and the use of information for planning, managing"}

When this vision is realized: Routine reporting from the district and sub-district level will be timely and will be available for decision making in less than 24 hours after data has been captured at source. Updates, reporting and feed back will be regular and data errors will be minimized. Reports on noti\ufb01able diseases will be in real time and early warning on impending outbreaks will be facilitated. Nurses and Health Assistants in remote areas will have easy on-line access to information and the services of experts in other parts of the country when confronted with health challenges in their area of operation. Every patient making a contact with any health facility or service, no matter where it is located, will bene\ufb01t from available expertise in other parts of the country without necessarily being referred. This will enhance performance and reduce referrals to ones that are absolutely necessary. Referrals will also be better coordinated and documented. Access to health information to enable the population make informed choices on health will be greatly enhanced. All available means of communication will be used to transmit appropriately packaged public health information to all sections of the population leading to increased awareness and adoption of healthier lifestyles. Diagnostic services will be provided without the need for movement of \ufb01les and folders by patients. Such reports will be transmitted electronically to doctors who requested them and this will help cut down the cost of such services drastically.

They will also be supported to stay healthy through access to reliable health information, better follow up services and continuing interaction with the health system to ensure that they continue to make better lifestyle choices. Health Care Managers will have access to a more robust, comprehensive and accurate body of data and information for decision making and planning. This will help them to make more targeted resource allocation and support resource mobilization drives. 5.0 THE NATIONAL E-HEALTH STRATEGY Increased use of Information and Communication Technology cannot be achieved without basic improvements in information structure, extended technical infrastructure and some changes or improved enforcement of the legal and policy framework for information management.

This will however be done systematically in order to help skilled workers appreciate the potential rather than see it as a new demand. 5.1 Strategy Overview The intent of the e-health strategy is to systematically deploy Information and Communication Technology to improve the health status of people living in Ghana. Although presently the penetration of technology in health care has improved dramatically, its application in many aspects of health care has been limited. Several factors have contributed to this and key among them are the inherent lack of capacity to use available technology in the day to day health care delivery activities. Capacity in this sense is not only about resources, both human and material. It is about the culture, work ethics and the need to make the application of technology an essential demand for accelerated performance in the medium term. This will require work in the area of training, development and implementation of new policies and programmes and incremental improvements in the use of information and communication technology based tools used in health care work and for communication between patients and care service providers. The necessary improvements have been captured under the following strategies. Strategy 1. Streamlining the regulatory framework for health data and information management GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 39 Strategy 2. Building sector capacity for wider application of e-health solutions in the"}

Computing equipment are susceptible to external threats like viruses, worms and hacking of corporate networks. Business continuity plans and disaster recover procedures are also not in place to ensure availability of connectivity. The deployment of e-health solutions in the health sector will be aimed at simplifying administrative processes and the reduction in data gathering and processing costs. It will also facilitate the delivery of health related information to remote locations within the sector.

GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 44 5.3 Strategy 2. Building Sector Capacity for Wider Application of E-Health 5.3.1 The Challenge One of the biggest challenges to e-health capacity building in Ghana is the shortage of quali\ufb01ed, trained health care professionals and training resources. Consequently the use of Information and Communication Technology in health is limited compared to the overall availability of tools and modern equipment that are capable of providing such services. New diagnostic equipment with electronic data transfer facilities exist in the system but are not utilized for such purposes. The health sector has one of the highest densities of computers in Ghana but almost all of them are used for simple word processing and spreadsheet applications. These challenges are as a result of high numbers of sta\ufb00 who are either not computer literate or have not yet adapted to the current ICT trend. The problem can also be traced to the training institutions where trainees have very little exposure to Information"}

Most persons driving and managing the existing e-Health Infrastructure and initiatives have not had proper professional training. With the few who have had some professional training, the Human resource scheme of service does not recognize such professionals and are most often placed in areas where they do not get involved in mainstream ICT related activities. Biostatisticians and regional information o\ufb03cers double as ICT experts. Most ICT capacity building initiative is directed at user training in the use applications rather than transfer technical skills for the long- term sustainability of the projects. Internal ICT support is very weak at all levels leading to a very weak oversight responsibility for ICT services that are outsourced. From various reports on capacity for ICT in the health sector, it has become increasingly clear that not much priority is placed on ICT in the health sector. This has led to slow adaptability in the area of Information and Communication Technology in the health sector. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 45 This strategy will aim at building institutional capacity for e-health by: \u2022 Building the human resource capacity for e-health \u2022 Improving organization-wide capacity for the deployment of e- health solutions 5.3.2 Current Situation Facilities for training (e-Learning) in the country are not at an advanced stage presently. Almost all the health training institutions in the country do not run e-learning programmes. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have started an eLearning training session for medical professionals.

Increasing Access and Bridging Equity Gap through Information and Communication Technology 5.4.1 The Challenge Availability of health services especially in the rural areas is constrained by need to travel long distances to reach health facilities. It is estimated that over 40% of the population live beyond one hour travel time to a health facility and a little over 50% live within 30 minutes travel time from a health facility. In certain areas particularly in the northern sector over 90% of the population do not have access to health services. In most of these areas outreach services are few and far between. To add to this problem, health facilities in these areas are usually only able to provide limited services due to lack of skill. Specialist services to a large"}

The underlying causes for this level of access are due to the inadequate service delivery points and a weak referral system, which is further, complicated by the lack of appropriate transport system. The low level of skill among health workers at the periphery, poor physical infrastructure, mal-distribution of sta\ufb00 and the lack of supervision, monitoring, regulation of sta\ufb00 and service delivery contributes to an unacceptable level of quality in many areas. In addition the level of technical competence, the handling of emergencies, frequent shortages of drugs and medical supplies have been identi\ufb01ed as major barriers to quality of care. Specialist support to the lower levels is also very limited due to the low numbers of specialists and the lack of facilities at the lower levels. The strategies adopted to overcome these constraints include the introduction of a close-to-client policy which aims at placing a trained public health nurse within communities to provide basic clinical and GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 49 public health services. It also includes the building of new facilities, improving sta\ufb00 skills through in-service training and the introduction of specialist outreach services. These strategies all have large recurrent implications and the mounting costs may a\ufb00ect expansion in the long run. The aim of the strategy is to: \u2022 Use Information and Communication technology to expanding the scope of activities of specialists \u2022 Support the transfer of skills and expertise to health workers in the periphery thereby improving their on-the-job performance \u2022 Support the establishment of a rapid response system to enhance performance in both clinical and public health care \u2022 Empower patients and clients to seek quality care and make the right demands on the health care system 5.4.2 Current"}

In the area of infrastructure, the expansion of mobile telephony presents the greatest development upon which aspects of the strategy can be further developed. Internet connectivity is available in all Regional Health Administrations via ADSL mode of connectivity. Institutions requiring heavy bandwidth are presently using VSAT. In areas unreachable by telephone landlines, connectivity is achieved by GPRS provided by Internet Service Providers. As part of the claims management processes, the National Health Insurance Scheme has established connectivity to all major health care provider. Local Area Networks are also widely available in hospitals. Although not at par with that of telephone network, infrastructure to GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 50 enable telemedicine can also be developed based on initial investments that have been made through Government of Ghana initiatives. The Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital for instance has facilities to support telemedicine. The Regenerative Health Programme also has limited use of mobile phones for disseminating public health messages. The Ministry of Health runs a Medicines Information Resource Centre that provides information on the use of drugs and pharmaceuticals to health care providers across the country. Although this focuses on medicines, it is becoming increasingly relevant that other areas of health care can bene\ufb01t from the programme. The lessons learnt from this programme will be looked at closely in the expansion of technical support services under this strategy. 5.4.3 Key Actions The key actions under this strategy will be in three main areas: \u2022 Use of mobile telephony for health services (m-health) \u2022 Use of audio visual support clinical decision making (telemedicine) \u2022 Use of electronic messages to promote public health 5.4.3.1 M-Health The Ministry of Health will use the signi\ufb01cant"}

This engagement will result in agreements on kinds of services, security and ethical requirements, special rates and other details that will allow health services to be assessed through the mobile phones ethically and unimpeded. \u2022 An interagency team will be put together to work with programmes and specialties to determine speci\ufb01c services that can be better managed and improved through the use of mobile telephony for the bene\ufb01t of patients, health care providers and the general public. This will be reviewed and implemented through the annual programme of work.

This will be liked to a data base to provide real-time information of selected diseases. 5.4.3.2 Telemedicine Tele medicine infrastructure is the least developed in the country. It is also one that requires signi\ufb01cant investment at the peripheral facilities as well as central facilities that will provide service. For these reasons the strategy will at the initial stages adopt a learning approach and work towards building capacity for training and scale up at all levels. Two main approaches will be adopted:"}

The following will be the main actions: \u2022 A task team of public health and health education experts will be put together to design health information messages covering access to health services, disease prevention and healthy lifestyle choices to constitute a body of information for use in public health campaigns through electronic media.

Towards A Paperless Records and Reporting System The health sector has within the last two decades gradually attempted to computerize a number of its operations. However, the only areas that have shown some degree of success in changing management practices have been the e\ufb00ort to computerize some logistics management systems. Computerization of patient information, medical records and patient GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 55 management processes in hospital has met with very little success especially in the public sector. A key barrier has been the relatively poor quality of computing infrastructure in many facilities and agencies. Computing infrastructure is one of the most basic foundations required for collecting, recording and sharing electronic information across the health sector. Unfortunately the health sector has traditionally under invested in computing infrastructure compared with other information intensive industries over the last twenty years. The result is that much of required infrastructure is either not existent or are under developed. To provide the foundation to support e-health, therefore, there will be the need to invest in the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable baseline of computing infrastructure in all health facilities. One of the key aims in the medium term will be to put in place a mechanism by which the health sector can gradually be transformed into an e\ufb00ective data management and information dissemination sector. Creating a completely paperless records and reporting system may take some time to achieve. This strategy is therefore aimed at achieving some clear improvements in the application of information and communication technology in the collection, storage, transfer and dissemination of health information. In this direction the strategy will focus on two main areas. \u2022 To improve performance"}

GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 56 5.5.1 Current Situation Several local initiatives have taken place in the area of health information management. A comprehensive mapping of data collection points within the sector has been conducted and this has helped in defining a health information management strategy for the sector. This outlines the reporting lines and responsibilities and the content of information to be provided by agencies. A District health Information Management System has also been developed and has currently been rolled out nationally. The system provides aggregate data from health facilities and programmes at the district level which are pooled together at the regional and national level. The DHIMS was developed in response to the need for annual reporting based on selected indicators. Within health facilities several uncoordinated efforts have been made to put in place computer assisted management systems that will help in managing revenue and patient information. With the introduction of the National Health Insurance scheme, steps are being taken to computerize the claims management system to ensure accountability. In the large hospitals computers are available at almost all service delivery points but these are not networked and do not have standard software to allow transactions to be pooled together at the end of the day. New diagnostic and laboratory equipment being brought into the system have electronic reporting and data capture capabilities but this is not used due to skill constraints and lack of patient management systems that allow for electronic transfer of reports to consulting rooms.

It is also important to note the degree of integration between system required and the extent to which change must be e\ufb00ected within stakeholder groups to enable unimpeded implementation. This section therefore de\ufb01nes a minimum arrangement for the implementation of the strategy. In doing so it is noted that the Ministry of Communication and the GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 70 Ministry of Health will be required to ensure continuing visibility of the targets aimed at in the speci\ufb01c areas of action. 7.1 Implementation Overview It is expected that at national and agency level, su\ufb03cient commitment will be given to the investment in and deployment of e-health solutions as part of the performance arrangement on yearly basis. The implementation arrangement also assumes that formal approval of the strategy will be given by the Ministry of Communication through its technical agencies and allowing the Ministry of Health to present the strategy as re\ufb02ecting its o\ufb03cial framework for guiding the sector-wide deployment of e-health solutions. The implementation of the strategy largely falls under the Ministry of Health and its agencies. Much of the actual demonstration of success will lie with agencies and therefore the need for a buy-in mechanism will be essential. A number of the action areas serve as pilot stages. Mechanism will be put in place to review such projects and use the lessons for scaling up where necessary."}

Government, through the Ministry of Communication, will de\ufb01ne standards, data protection rules and regulations and put in place GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 71 mechanisms for enforcement and adherence. Direct supervision will be provided jointly by the Technical units of the Ministry of Communication and the Ministry of Health and its relevant agency. This module will ensure that in places where stakeholders are better placed to drive outcomes su\ufb03cient scope is given through consultations to ensure rapid and successful deployment. Key consideration will be given to innovation and the adoption of corporate stances that will enable quick public health outcomes. The development of speci\ufb01c e-health solutions will be predominantly driven by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with stakeholders and solution vendors. It is expected that such arrangements should enable the development of e-health solutions that meet speci\ufb01c health sector needs. Government, through the Ministry of Health will therefore have overall responsibility for setting national e-health agenda and priorities. Government will be responsible for directly funding, implementing and operating e-health infrastructure. Government will also stimulate and encourage the market to develop quality e-health solutions that are scalable, standards compliant and aligned with national priorities.

It will also review and approve e-health projects and monitor the progress and outcomes of the e-health strategy and review implementation priorities as and when necessary. The committee will advise the minister of health on e-health investment cases. A Technical Advisory Committee will also be established to provide support to e-health initiatives and to test the compliance with national standards. This committee will report to the Interagency Ministerial Committee. The National Information Technology Agency will implement and enforce the national e-health regulatory framework. This will cover regulations on integrity, privacy and security of personal health care information. The Agency will develop and maintain national e-health standards and the delivery of speci\ufb01c national e-health infrastructure foundations including the establishment and implementation of national e-health solution compliance testing and certi\ufb01cation. 7.4 Stakeholder Involvement It is recognized that for a successful implementation of the strategy there will be the need for continuous engagement of a broad range of interests representing public and private sector providers, professional groups, government, e-health solution vendors and community groups. GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY Stakeholder involvement will be vigorously sought to provide input into the appropriateness and functionality of e-health structures and to prioritize e-health solutions. Stakeholder perspectives on e\ufb00ectiveness of e-health solution will be a critical monitoring and evaluation factor. As part of the implementation arrangements, the Ministry of Health will establish stakeholder engagement forums with appropriate representation across providers, professionals, government organizations, health care consumers and private sector technology vendors and ensure that their inputs are used to shape direction of the strategy.

They will also be involved in de\ufb01ning the changes required for professional education, training and accreditation programs and will play a role in the development of professional practice standards. 7.5 The Roadmap for Implementation The implementation of the e-health strategy will be phased with the sector medium term planning process. This means that there will be four year intensive implementation of priority components of the strategy depending on availability of funds and sound e-health infrastructure. Each medium tern plan will de\ufb01ne planning horizons to guide investments and stakeholder participation in the roll out of the national e-health strategy. In broad terms, the \ufb01rst four years will be a period of intense e\ufb00orts and putting in place such building blocks as standards and regulatory framework, establishment of pilot programmes and creating su\ufb03cient 73 GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY scope for learning and development of both human resource and institutional capacity. The second four years will be a period of modest national scale up of tested and well rehearsed e-health solutions. It will also be a period for galvanizing stakeholder involvement and ensuring that sustainability issues are dealt with comprehensively. The third four years will be used to consolidate e-health as a tool for improved performance of the health sector and for ensuring e\ufb00ective coverage. 7.6 Implementation Land Marks It is essential to ensure that slippage in the implementation of the strategy is reduced as much as possible. Although most of the actions de\ufb01ned under the four strategies will require signi\ufb01cant change within the sector, it is expected that with the coordinating mechanisms in place resource availability and commitment will be maintained at a high level.

It is expected that this will be reviewed at the end of each medium term period. 7.7 Monitoring And Evaluation Based on the principle that e-health adoption is towards improved and accelerated achievement of sector targets, the overall monitoring and evaluation arrangement will be part of the agreed sector framework for monitoring and evaluation. Consequently, priority action will be taken as part of the annual programme of work so as to lend themselves to the annual review exercises. The annual review of the health sector is done by an independent team put together by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with development partners in the health sector. Programmes outlined in this strategy will therefore form part of the areas of assessment and will be reported on at the summit. Key priority actions being undertaken will be captured in the sector aide memoire and will be tracked along side other policy and service indicators. 75 GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY Day to day monitoring of implementation of e-health solutions will be done by the Interagency Ministerial Committee.

Steps will be taken to ensure that agencies make provisions within their budgets for key actions that relate to their core business. Service renewals involving data safety and security will be considered strongly in the annual budgets. Donor funding will be sought to cover huge one o\ufb00 investments such as the bulk acquisition of hardware and mass training programmes. It will also be used to support the initial steps in the capacity development programmes and activities. Where external technical support is required, this will be sourced through donor funding. Funding for the establishment of services such as the electronic patient record system will be sought through \ufb02exible funding arrangements with solution vendors. This will be in such a way as to allow payment to be done from the revenue enhancements that the systems will achieve. Although tangible bene\ufb01ts from the deployment of e-health will be di\ufb03cult to demonstrate e\ufb00ectively, it is expected that over time these will show in improved revenue and reduced expenditure on services, training and wastage in logistics management. It will also, over time deliver a higher quality of care, a more equitable distribution of services and an overall responsive health system for Ghana. 79 GHANA E-HEALTH STRATEGY 80"}

Introduction The discovery of antimicrobials has played an important role in decreasing morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases. The success of infectious disease treatment has been one of modern medicine\u2019s greatest achievements. Expansion and improvement in health systems and resources, coupled with production technologies across the world has also led to increase in availability and access to antimicrobials. Over the years, improved access to antimicrobials has been accompanied by poor practices that have"}

The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance has been recognized as one of the major health problems globally and it is compounded in low-resource countries (WHO, 2014). Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is resistance of a microorganism to an anti- microbial drug that was originally effective for treatment of infections caused by it (WHO, 2014). Resistant microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, viruses and other parasites) are able to withstand attack by antimicrobial drugs, such as antibacterial drugs, antifungals, antivirals, and antimalarials, so that standard treatments become inef- fective. Antimicrobial resistance results in prolonged illness, as well as increased burden on health systems and insurance schemes. It also hampers the control of infectious diseases, increases the cost of healthcare, affects health security, damages trade and economies and threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era (WHO, 2014). Prolonged ill-health may result in loss of man-hours and productivity and hence loss of income to the family and the nation at large. The threat of AMR and its impact now and the future across all sectors includ- ing animal, agriculture, the environment etc. is real, as it affects commonly used and affordable antimicrobials. The need to address this precarious situation now is critical to preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobials. There are several factors that contribute to the development of AMR. These include: \u0003 ~ Irresponsible and/or inappropriate use of antimicrobials \u0003 ~ Lack of information on the proper use of antimicrobials \u0003 ~ Absence of policy on antimicrobial access and use \u0003 ~ Spurious, Substandard, Falsified, Fake and Counterfeit antimicrobials \u0003 ~ Unregulated access to antimicrobials \u0003 ~ Use of antimicrobials in agriculture as growth promoters \u0003 ~ Poor infection prevention and control in health facilities page 4 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition"}

This policy was prepared with broad consultation with multi-stakeholders in- volving public and private sector agencies, academia, research institutions and civil society organizations. There are some policies and guidelines that define approaches to the use of antimicrobials mainly in human health but are largely absent for other sectors such as food, agriculture, fisheries, the environment, etc. The policy therefore seeks to develop strategies that will assure responsible use of antimicrobials and help control the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance across all sectors of Ghana. In this policy, interventions in areas such as responsible use of antimicrobials, infection prevention and control, waste management, strengthening disease control programmes, laboratory diagnostics and protocols, national surveillance for antimi- crobials, regulation and enforcement, antimicrobial manufacturing, distribution and use, and legislative and legal framework among others will be defined across all sectors i.e. human, animal, agriculture, and environment. 1.5 Trends in antimicrobial resistance 1.5.1 Global trends WHO reports that, about 440 000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculo- sis (MDR-TB) emerge annually, causing at least 150 000 deaths. Extensively drug-resis- tant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been reported in 64 countries (WHO, 2014). It is also reported that, a high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). AMR has become a serious problem for treatment of gonorrhea (caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae), involving \u201clast-line\u201d oral cephalosporins. This phenomenon is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Untreatable gonococcal infections would result in increased rates of illness and"}

AMR is also an emerging concern for treatment of HIV infection, after the rapid expansion in access to antiretroviral drugs in recent years. page 5 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 At the end of 2011, more than 8 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries to treat HIV. Although analysis of data from WHO surveys that target people who have been recently infected with HIV indicates increasing levels of resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) class of drug used to treat HIV. This increase is particularly noticeable in Af- rica, where the prevalence of resistance to NNRTI reached 3.4% (95% CI, 1.8-5.2%) in 2009 (WHO, 2014). Over the past 10 years, antiviral drugs have become important tools for treat- ment of epidemic and pandemic influenza. It was estimated that, by 2012, virtually all influenza A viruses circulating in humans would be resistant to drugs frequently used for the prevention of influenza (amantadine and rimantadine). Antiviral susceptibility is constantly monitored through the WHO Global Surveillance and Response System. There is evidence to show that aquaculture has been contributing to the global development and spread of AMR. Isolates of bacteria from tilapia and other fish species in Tanzania and other countries were found to be resistant to the antimicrobials com- monly used in human medicine, even in some farms where these antimicrobials had not been used (Shah, 2012). Pseudomonas and Staphylococcal isolates from fish have been found to exhibit resistance to nine antimicrobials, with the highest rate of 77% to tetra- cycline (Miller-Morgan, 2014). Samples of seafood (shrimp and salmon) collected from 11 countries across the world showed detectable levels of antimicrobials, with that of"}

This trend is expected to increase, with serious public health implications if drastic steps are not taken to arrest the situation (Done et al 2015). Consumption of food with significant levels of residual antimicrobials over time could lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. 1.5.2 Trends in African countries In Africa, antibiotics are among the commonest prescribed medicines. A survey on predictors of antibiotic use in five countries in Africa showed that 90% of individuals with acute illness sought care outside the home with 95% receiving medicines and 36% received antibiotics. Of the antibiotics received, cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and met- ronidazole represented 75% of received antibiotics. Over 30% of individuals accessed antibiotics without prescription and one in four individuals obtained antibiotics from an informal dispenser. This survey also reported various levels of resistance to antibiot- ics in the sampled countries. (Newman, Frimpong, Donkor, & Opintan, 2011), (WHO, 2014) Many African countries reported the presence of resistant strains of bacteria. For instance, in Nigeria, there is high resistance to vancomycin, gentamycin, chloram- phenicol and cloxacillin. (Umolu, et al 2002) page 6 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 1.5.3 Trends in Ghana The overall primary drug resistance rate of 23.5% in Ghanaian TB patients ranks Ghana among those African countries with a high prevalence of drug-resistant TB. (Owusu-Dabo & Ohene, 2006) Various studies carried out proved the existence of antibiotic resistance in Gha- na. A study in two teaching, seven regional and two district hospitals in Ghana showed that, very common microbes such as Streptococci, Salmonella, and E. coli showed very high levels of multiple drug resistance; some as high as 78.7%. In the various hospitals sampled, the prevalence of resistance to common and affordable antimicrobials such as tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, ampicillin and nalidixic acid"}

The absence of national antibiotic use policy that guides the use and control of resistance is also contributing immensely to the upsurge in abuse of antibiotics at the community and the institutional level across the country (Gyansa-Lutterodt M, 2013). page 8 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 2 Situational Analysis 2.1 Use of antimicrobials in veterinary, food, fisheries and aquaculture In the food, agriculture and fisheries sectors, the ever-increasing exchange of fresh and processed products has contributed to the development and"}

Bacteria isolated over the years from livestock, poultry and their products and from surfaces of tables and knives at slaughter houses, included resistant strains of Campylobacter jejeni, E coli (12 serovars) and Salmonella spp. These microbes were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, cefadoxil, erythromycin, cefotiam, penicillin (Sackey et al 2001, quoted by Turkson, 2014). The per- centage of resistance to these antimicrobial drugs ranged from 61% to 97% (see Table 3 in annex). The preponderance of multivalent antimicrobial medicines over monovalent ones for use in veterinary practice during the past two decades, points to the decline or total loss in the efficacy of the monovalent preparations in treating the same in- fections for which they were very successfully used in the past. This phenomenon was confirmed by most of the animal health care personnel, farmers and veterinary drug distributors interviewed in a recent survey carried out in the Greater Accra, Ashanti and the Brong Ahafo Regions (Hanson, 2016). In crop production, fungicides are the most common antimicrobials used against diseases and pests. The replacement of existing fungicides with new ones at regular in- tervals may be an indication of development of resistance by pests and diseases to the former. It may be inferred that waste water from livestock and poultry establishments and other rubbish dumps serve as sources of spread of resistant pathogens. Untreated manure may also contribute to the spread of resistant microbes in the soil and the environment. This has its serious implications and consequences for food and nutrition security. In aquaculture, interviews with farmers have indicated that antimicrobials are added to feeds for growth promotion. Antimicrobials are also directly added to the ponds or cages for disease prevention and control. The indication for the use of the agents and"}

About 80% of the antimicrobials used in aquaculture enter the environment with their activity intact, where they select for bacteria whose resistance arises from mutations, or more importantly, from mobile genetic elements containing multiple resistance determinants transmissible to other bacteria (Cabello, F.C. et al, 2013). Consumption of farmed fish, especially in situations page 9 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 where withdrawal periods are not adhered to results in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The antimicrobial agents used in aquaculture belong to the same classes as those used in livestock and in humans and these are; the macrolides, cephalosporins, beta-lactams, sulphonamides and quinolones. Fish farming also contributes to contam- ination of the environment with resistant bacteria when untreated manure from live- stock establishments, which may contain such organisms, is used as feed fish and the effluent discharged without being processed. Although a fish health unit exist in the Fisheries Commission, the unit is not adequately resourced to monitor antimicrobial use in aquaculture. The use of antimicrobials for disease prevention and growth promotion in ani- mal husbandry, and the existence of antibiotic residues in the food chain are also likely to compound the problem of antibiotic resistance (Schmidt, 2009), (Xuan Le T, et al 2005),. (Donkor, Tetteh-Quarcoo, Nartey, & Agyeman, 2012). A case study from Ghana on the presence of beta-lactamase producing Esche- richia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates as well as tetracycline residues in chicken meat established the occurrence of drug resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains isolated from chicken meat bought in Ghana. In addition, high incidence of tet- racycline residues was found in the chicken meat samples (Rasmussen, 2014). Another study on the"}

The Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety Unit together with the Laborato- ry and Epidemiology Units of the Veterinary Services Division (VSD) are responsible for monitoring the use of antibiotics and surveillance of resistance in animals. The overall goal of the Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety Unit is to prevent zoonotic diseases in humans and assure food safety. Collaboration with MOH is mainly in the area of zoonotic diseases and not on antimicrobial resistance. In the past, antimicrobial resistance has not been a priority for the veterinary services in Ghana. There are no acceptable national standards for; antibiotic residue in veterinary and aquaculture produce; no testing for antibiotic residue is done, and no minimum allowable weaning period before slaughter and processing. The FDA regulates importation and is also responsible for the registration; post market surveillance and quality assurance of all medicines including antimicrobials used in veterinary services (Ghana Public Health Act, 851, 2012). page 10 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 2.2 Responsible use of Medicines At the health facility level, there are inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics.

The sources of these antimi- crobials are unknown and quality cannot be guaranteed. Prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics amongst tertiary students was as high as 75% (Donkor et al, 2012). The most common antibiotic used was amoxicillin. Traditional medicine practice is another area where antimicrobials are abused. Anecdotal reports suggest that antibiotics have been used to adulterate some herbal products. The Responsible Use of Medicines (RUM) is one of the key ingredients in any plan to control the development and spread of AMR.

The Ghana National Medicines Policy recommends routine monitoring of re- sponsible use of medicines. Since 1998, Ghana has been implementing the rational use of medicines programme, with the aim of improving medicine use. The rational use of medicines concept demands that patients receive medicines appropriate to their clin- ical needs in doses that meet individual requirements and for the right duration.

Such data has been used for advocacy on AMR and related issues.

The goal of infection prevention and control is to identify and address all the factors which may introduce infection and spread it page 12 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 within the farm. Absence of infection makes a farming enterprise more productive, since less money is spent on treatments. This will also lead to a potential decrease in the use of antimicrobials and therefore contribute to slowing down the development and spread of resistant pathogens.

In food, agriculture and fisheries sectors, pathogens can be introduced and spread through the air, water, feed or equipment and tools being used, and in some instances by personnel. Visitors may also introduce infection through contaminated items such as used egg crates, sacks, other containers, clothing and means of transport. Wild animals, birds, insects etc. may also be implicated. However, over the years, not much attention has been placed on infection pre- vention and control activities due to numerous factors, such as: \u0003 ~ Absence of policy on infection control \u0003 ~ Inadequate logistics \u0003 ~ Lack of appreciation of the importance of infection prevention and control ac- tivities It is only after major disease outbreaks that some ad-hoc measures are put in place for infection prevention.

There has been slow progress in improving hand hygiene practices across patient care points within healthcare facilities. An Emergency, Obstetrics and Neonatal care study in 2011 showed 8% of facilities out of 1268 had no water source. In one region, 25% of health facilities out of a total of 96 had no water source. These have great implications for hand hygiene practices. (Ghana Health Service, 2011) In the absence of hand washing sinks and running water, \u2018\u2019Veronica buckets\u2019\u2019 are commonly used in most health facilities. However recent studies have shown contam- ination of water in these containers with microbes due to inadequate cleaning. There are very few hand washing and toilet facilities for patients in the healthcare setting. In a study done by Asare et al; compliance to hand hygiene recommendations before and after patient contact was 15.4% and 38.5% for physicians, 4.1% and 9.9% for nurses.

In 2003, the first national policy on infection prevention and control was devel- oped with engagement of staff in the teaching hospitals and limited training of other health workers. In 2009, a first revision was conducted introducing infection preven- tion and control considerations for antibiotic use. With further stakeholder involve- ment, extensive dissemination and training of health workers was undertaken. With the emergence of newer pandemic diseases, a new revision was undertaken in 2015.

It includes col- lection, treatment, transportation, disposal and monitoring. Waste management should start from the point of generation. Ideally there should be segregation of waste before collection, transportation, treatment and disposal. The goal of waste management is to prevent the adverse effect of waste on health and the environment. Waste can be a major source of spreading pathogenic and resistant microor- ganism, which will not only result in health problems but also lead to increased cost of production and productivity losses in the food, agriculture and fisheries sectors.

About 10-25% of waste generated in health facilities are hazardous, and require special arrangement for man- agement. Examples of hazardous health care wastes are pathological waste such as tissues and body fluids, pharmaceuticals (expired and unused drugs), sharps (syringes, disposables, and scalpels) and radio-active waste. There is slow progress in improving healthcare waste management. Waste is often not segregated, where sharps are col- lected in separate containers, the containers are often left to overflow. Color coding practices are not often adhered to. Open dumping is a common practice, however, where incinerators are provided their maintenance and use is hampered by lack of resources. There is an MOH waste management policy developed in 2006 that seeks to ensure that, health care waste is managed effectively in compliance with existing laws and regulations and others to be passed in future in order to protect health care work- ers, their clients (patients, caregivers and visitors) and the environment from poten- tial disease-causing waste materials. The Guidelines provide standards, procedures and processes for handling health care waste in health sector institutions and mechanisms for performance monitoring.

Other wastes are dumped among domestic waste without initial processing to render them harmless. Improper waste management could lead to the introduction and spread of re- sistant pathogens as well as the introduction of sub-lethal quantities of antimicrobials into the environment that could promote resistance. 2.4 Strengthening Disease Control Programs New diseases and epidemics may emerge at any time while existing diseases may pose new challenges to health. Some of these diseases can easily be transferred between human, animal and the environment and present public health challenges. Timely response to control disease outbreaks in all sectors (human, animals and plants), not only prevents or reduces the spread of these diseases, the harm it posses and the associated economic loss, but also reduces the cost of the control exercises. It is therefore important to have in place for all the sectors, standard operational principles or general guidelines for the control of disease outbreaks and specific strategies for very important ones (those of great socio-economic importance). Most disease control programmes in Ghana have structures and standard oper- ating procedures for implementation when disease outbreaks occur. However, inade- quate funding of programme activities has been the main challenge. Regular support for activities at the community level is low, hence, adherence to positive lifestyle activities and prevention is often adhoc. Surveillance and routine monitoring of antimicrobials used in some programmes is lacking. There is little or no private-public partnership in disease control programmes. Though there is an established system to deal with disease outbreaks, its implementation is often adhoc. Disease control programs for the Food, Agriculture and Fisheries sectors are weak.

Quarantine facilities are few and often not in good state. Movement restrictions for animals and plants are difficult to enforce for these sectors. Often diseased animals, plants, fish and their products are transported to clean areas with ease. Poor record keeping and weak enforcement of regulation presents challenges in tracing sources of disease outbreaks. Difficulties are experienced in accurately di- agnosing disease due to the weak laboratory presence in most of the areas where the farms are located. Added to these factors is the problem of trained human resource inadequacies. page 16 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 2.5 Laboratory diagnostics and protocol requirements There are some policies and regulatory structures in place to support the pro- vision of laboratory services for health care, for example the national laboratories pol- icy for human health. The goal is to ensure optimal delivery of laboratory services for the various levels of healthcare delivery for both public and private sectors. This ser- vice is to ensure that the antimicrobials introduced are specific for the disease-causing microbes and contribute to the containment of antimicrobial resistance. A large majority of primary care laboratories do not have the capacity to do microbiology tests due to inadequate capacity, inadequate human resource, equipment and reagents. Culture and sensitivity is not done in most cases for the following reasons: \u0003 ~ Most clinicians do not request for sensitivity test for diagnosis and treatment \u0003 ~ Weak capacity of some labs to do sensitivity testing \u0003 ~ Antimicrobial discs used for sensitivity testing are based on what the agents provide Within the food, agriculture and fisheries sectors,"}

There are also not enough personnel to run the few ones. The Fisheries Commission is now putting up a fish pathology laboratory in Accra. The Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate (PPRSD) has only one plant pathology laboratory in the country, located in Accra. It can diagnose fungal and bacterial diseases, but not viral diseases. It lacks the ability to carry out sensitivity tests and thus the ability to detect AMR. The Research Institutes however have similar laboratories with greater capabilities. The Seed Inspectorate Division of PPRSD has one national seed laboratory in Accra and six (6) satellite laboratories at Winneba, Kumasi, Tamale, Wa, Bolgatanga and Ho. Those in Accra, Wa, Bolgatanga and Tamale test for fungal contamination whilst the other only carries out germination tests.

This Act regulates the services provided by health profession- als in the country. The overall legal framework for medicines including antimicrobials is set out in the Public Health Act 2012 (Act 851) and enforced by the FDA. There are no specific provisions on antimicrobials in these Acts. The policy framework for the regulation of antimicrobials is weak or non-exis- tent. The existing policies of essential medicines in general do apply to antimicrobials. There is however, a specific policy intervention for infectious diseases such as malaria, TB and HIV, which has been under global fund support over the years. Regulations and their enforcement are very important if any headway is to be made in the fight to control the AMR threats. The FDA and Pharmacy council are re- sponsible for medicine regulation and enforcement. FDA regulates the manufacture of local antibiotics as well as the importation; however, there are concerns that there may be high levels of substandard, spurious, fake, falsified, counterfeits (SSFSCs) antimicrobi- als on the market. Study by Bekoe and Ahiabu., showed that antibiotic supplies from the informal sector were of lower quality than those from the formal sector (Bekoe and Ahiabu, 2014). The importation through unapproved routes makes regulation difficult. The sale of antimicrobials on the open markets, vehicles and unapproved locations is also a source of concern. Ghana has a large number of regulations covering the operations of the food, agriculture and fisheries sectors on the use of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, waste man- agement, etc. The challenge however, is the enforcement of these laws. The FDA and EPA are responsible for the registration of drugs, feeds and other chemicals used in the food and agricultural sectors. Monitoring"}

Even though imports of drugs should be only through the Kotoka International Airport and the Tema Harbour, many come through unapproved routes. It is therefore difficult to keep track of all the antimicrobials being used in Gha- na, and their efficacy. 2.8 Antibiotic Manufacturing, Distribution and Use The Private sector is the main actor when it comes to the manufacturing of medicines including antibiotics. The Government however provide tax incentives for the private sector.

Seiter and Gyansa-Lutterodt, 2009, indicate that about 150 companies are licensed or registered national or regional wholesalers of pharmaceutical products Distribution of medicines is characterized by complex interaction between the public, self-financed and faith-based sectors. Antimicrobials distribution does not fol- low a specified system or pattern. The distribution is as occurs with other essential medicines. Ghana operates a pull system for essential drugs where facilities decide periodically what they require and purchase either from the next level or from the private sector. Most of the major manufacturers have an integrated distribution business with fixed distribution points in several regions and mobile vans that make scheduled tours to deliver medicines to more remote locations. Due to the free market and poor enforcement of regulations, antimicrobial dis- tribution cannot be tracked easily. Unrestricted access makes it possible for untrained persons to access and distribute antimicrobials. Limited number of health cadres and their poor distribution to the rural areas have created a delicate balance between access and proper antimicrobial therapy. There is no written strategy to monitor the use of antimicrobials in the health page 20 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 facilities. There is"}

(Medicines Transparency Alliance Ghana, 2010) Prescribing by na- tional guidelines is poorly adhered to. Non-pneumonia acute ARI of any age treated with antibiotics stood at 100%. Almost all the antimicrobials used in food, agriculture and fisheries sectors are imported into the country. Apart from the cocoa sector where COCOBOD does the importation, all the antimicrobial agents are imported, stored and distributed by the private sector. The same problems encountered by the human health sector in the manu- facture, distribution and use of antimicrobials are the same encountered in the food, agriculture and fisheries sectors. 2.9 Legislative and legal framework/policies There is a national medicines policy for the health sector which does not spe- cifically mention antimicrobial resistance. Standard guidelines exist for the use of anti- microbials in the treatment of infectious diseases. This serves as a guidance document only and there are no legal provisions to enforce adherence to the STG. The Ghana EML, which is extracted from the STG, serves only as basis for public procurement and also in defining the NHIA medicines list (Seiter & Gyansa-Lutterodt, 2009). For a summary of key findings from situational analysis informing the policy on antimicrobial use and resistance in Ghana, see Table 4 in the annex. page 21 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 3 Policy Goals, Objectives and Strategies 3.1 Preamble The AMR policy has been developed to improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education and training.

It is expected that the use of antimicrobial agents in humans, plants and animal health would be optimized in the \u2018one health\u2019 approach through specific interventions in Responsible Use of Antimicrobials in humans, veterinary and aquaculture as well as in the environment and industry. The policy also recommends specific regulatory interventions to deal with manufacturing, supply chain, and to also increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools and vaccines. It is emphasized that a strong multi-stakeholder collaboration, which has made the development of this policy a success, would also strengthen the implementation of this policy under existing governance structures. The policy seeks a systemic balance between access and excess to preserve antimicrobials for current and future genera- tions. Figure 2: Conceptual framework for AMR interventions in Ghana page 22 Policy on Antimicrobial Use and Resistance for Ghana, 1st Edition 2017 3.2 Goal The overall goal of this policy is to improve and sustain the health of the popu- lation (human, animal and plants) in their environment and enhancing food security by ensuring the responsible use and access to safe, effective and affordable antimicrobials of good quality as well as slow the emergence of resistant microbes and prevent the spread of resistant infections in \u2018\u2019one-health\u2019\u2019 approach. 3.3 Policy Objectives The objectives are to: \u0003 ~ Improve awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communica- tion, education and training \u0003 ~ Strengthen knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research \u0003 ~ Reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infec- tion prevention measures and good agricultural and biosecurity practices \u0003 ~ Optimize the use of antimicrobial agents in human and animal health, aquacul- ture and crop production \u0003 ~ Develop the economic case and create an enabling environment for"}

The plan is directly linked to the Ghana Universal Health Care Vision, with focus functional areas organized by the 11 technical areas of the National Supply Chain Assessment and guided by four transformational pillars: coordination and collaboration, innovation, transparency, and sustainability. Each \u201cfocus functional area\u201d section presents a quick \u201cstock keeping\u201d overview that recaps the key findings of the NSCA maturity assessment, describes progress to date and notes ongoing challenges. Priorities for the functional area are then aligned with each of the SCMP\u2019s transformational pillars to ensure each of these key themes are infused throughout all strategies and interventions. The most important portion of each section is a competency-based improvement pathway. These \u201cpathways\u201d are competency-based as they were built in direct response to the competency assessment of the NSCA. We set forth a look at the current state, vision for future state in 2025, and an overall strategic pathway to get from \u201ca\u201d to \u201cb.\u201d This pathway is then presented in detail through strategic interventions paired with annual performance targets.

The following provides a quick overview of the strategy for each area. Strategic Planning and Management. This SCMP is an opportunity to re-examine all levels of the SC system and to build political leadership that supports reform. Moving forward, in the absence of a Supply Chain Management Agency, it will be necessary to harmonise SC responsibilities and to create complementarity in roles and responsibilities among the MOH and agencies. The goal is a well-coordinated ecosystem of SC actors, including a robust market of private sector entities that is stewarded by the GOG. An overarching priority remains to ensure that all necessary SC functions are fully covered; those existing entities are sufficiently empowered; and that the respective roles, responsibilities, and relationships amongst actors are clearly and universally understood. The SCMP will provide coordinated leadership and governance across MOH and its agencies; reflected in clear guidance regarding functional roles and responsibilities, disseminated to all regions, and reviewed annually. Policy and Governance. The SCMP will lay the framework to implement strong accountability and governance structures to hold agencies and the private sector accountable for performance. More inclusive policies and stronger governance structures will promote sustainability by bringing in more local actors (private sector, civil society) and inform proper resource allocation. Enhanced coordination according to clear policy and governance structures will strengthen existing linkages. The SCMP strategy will focus on decentralising governance of vertical SCs to the regions whilst transitioning the central level to conduct intensive supportive supervision in which regions are held accountable based on performance scorecards. It will enhance the supportive supervision role of the central regions over the"}

Opportunities for SC-specific capacity building exist, as the presence of dedicated and professionally trained SC personnel is most significant at the highest levels of the public health system and lacking at lower levels. Capacity development must occur at multiple levels (e.g., individual, organisational, societal) and across sectors (public, commercial, civil society) to be successful. The SCMP will aim to standardise SC capacity development at all levels and introduce a Continuing Professional Development program for SC personnel. Implementation of the SCMP will focus on professionalisation and more innovative and sustainable methods of workforce development. Financial Sustainability. To develop a well-coordinated financial system that supports the public health system, implementation of the SCMP will include a mapping exercise to understand the flow of money and tracking of expenditures at each level. To attain financial sustainability of SC at all levels, the MOH must focus on framework contracting, PPPs, NHIA reform, and the respective linkages with SC. Drug Revolving Fund (DRF) operated in the regions should be replicated at the district, SDP, and sub-district levels. The SCMP will focus on interventions to settle outstanding debts and establish and enforce future payment deadlines and support the design of a dedicated Financial Sustainability Plan to guide this critical area. Forecasting and Supply Planning. Sustained, high-performing FASP is dependent on the tools and staff capacity. The SCMP proposes a gradual shift to using common FASP software and data inputs on GhiLMIS consumption across all disease areas, including essential medicines, to attain a coordinated FASP program. This will include standardisation of SOPs across programmatic areas and facility levels, establishing a dedicated FASP Unit to streamline processes, and provision of capacity building to enable government-led quantification at central and regional levels.

A critical element will be the agreement and buy-in of all partners that the goal is to transition the implementation of procurement function to the GOG. Warehousing and Storage. To reach constant stock turnaround, adherence to GWP, and consistent monitoring, the MOH will invest in physical and human capacity to bring all warehouses at central, regional, and SDP levels to Ghana FDA standards and ensure SOPs and other tools are prepared to international practice levels and implemented by well-trained commodity managers. The plan will implement strategies that enhance labour efficiency and improve management capacity of all warehouses. In addition, it will create an enabling environment for a standardised, modern warehousing infrastructure that promotes good warehousing practice. Distribution. Improvements in distribution will be driven by an optimised distribution strategy paired with a detailed sustainability plan to reach a state in which commodity distribution plans are structured, implemented, and monitored to achieve regular on-time distribution to SDPs. vii Developed according to a root cause analysis of stockouts at SDPs, the strategy will introduce innovative contract mechanisms and performance metrics, and increased use of the private sector. The MOH will leverage on existing experiences in-country and coordinate the development of a broad-based strategy -- through comprehensive consultative processes -- to provide clear regulatory guidance and operational procedures to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for transportation of medical suppliers.

To realise a fully mature, secure eLMIS that facilitates end-to-end SC visibility through interoperability with other systems, interventions of the SCMP will formalise LMIS responsibilities within job descriptions, establish a SC data governance structure and design and implement a sustainable performance-based incentive mechanism for SC data generation and use, among other efforts. Quality and Pharmacovigilance. Through implementation of the SCMP, the MOH will improve patient care and safety through its agencies by strengthening the recall system of health products and medical devices (e.g., batch management of inventory, adopting GS1 coding) and by developing human resources capacity to manage FDA laboratories and PV activities. In addition, a Ghana Pharmaceutical Traceability Strategy Document will be prepared to ensure the availability and appropriate use of quality medicines and medical products. This strategy will be a starting point for the MOH and FDA to jointly organise and operationalise the foundational work that will support traceability implementation. Waste Management. Through the SCMP, we will review and disseminate policies and SOPs on specialised waste disposal to improve implementation at all levels, and advocate to expand budgets to improve the pharmaceutical and health care waste infrastructure at all levels. An active costed implementation plan will be prepared and supported in the application of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle. Partnering with the Private Sector. To promote greater private sector, the MOH \u2014 through SCMP implementation \u2014 will involve the private sector in strategic planning and develop a national private sector engagement strategy to guide implementation of cost-effective SC initiatives. Engagements will focus on mobilizing additional capital and introducing alternative management and implementation skills. 1 1.0 Background Reviewing Supply Chain Master Plan 2015-2020 The 2015-2020 SCMP systematically"}

Progress has since been made in the development of national policies, guidelines, and SOPs, as well as in the design and rollout of the GhiLMIS. Today, several original recommendations from the 2015-2020 SCMP remain pertinent, underscored by updated data on the current situation of Ghana\u2019s public health SC system. In the aftermath of the 2015 fire that gutted the central medical stores (CMS) in Tema, the MOH partnered with its health development partners, notably the Global Fund and USAID, to prioritise the implementation of key interventions from the 2015-2020 SCMP. These interventions were to ensure several outcomes: \u2022 The systematic and scheduled delivery of health commodities from the two central-level warehouses through the 10 traditional regional medical stores (RMSs) and to more than 4,000 service delivery points (SDPs), \u201cthe last mile\u201d dotted around the country. \u2022 The execution of a framework contracting mechanism in which all RMSs and teaching hospitals will procure an agreed list of commodities from prequalified vendors at an agreed competitive price. \u2022 The establishment of an electronic logistics management information system (eLMIS) to derive reliable and timely data to guide SC decision-making at higher levels. \u2022 The implementation of a warehouse policy and strategy based on optimised solutions that improves the public warehousing conditions at central and regional levels. A review of the interventions (February 2020) revealed significant progress in SC performance objectives in the health sector, specifically: \u2022 The scheduled delivery of commodities from the RMSs to 100% of SDPs to subdistrict level was attained, i.e., regional hospitals, district hospitals, polyclinics, and health centres. \u2022 A warehousing strategy to optimise commodity management and distribution was developed but has yet to be fully implemented. \u2022 A framework contracting mechanism for"}

These achievements notwithstanding, implementation of the 2015-2020 SCMP faced myriad challenges, from the inability of the MOH to establish an autonomous agency for SC oversight to limited funding for SC activities across all levels. To date, a substantial part SC activities funding (including procurement of health commodities) has been provided by development 2 partners, primarily the Global Fund and USAID. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other development partners supported the procurement of contraceptives, nutrition, and other critical public health commodities. Consequently, the 2021-2025 SCMP must address the observed challenges by developing interventions that will enable a national SC system that is integrated, effective, efficient, lean, agile, and sustainable. A key task of the 2021-2025 SCMP is to reconsider the priorities outlined in the 2015-2020 SCMP according to the current SC capabilities and performance and, crucially, in the context of contemporary leadership, priorities, economic, and political realities. The goal is to create a new list of priority reforms and interventions to continue to ensure the availability of quality health commodities by 2025. National Supply Chain Assessment The NSCA established the presence or absence of key capabilities across 11 technical areas at all facility levels and collected key performance indicators (KPIs). The 2019 NSCA, in assessing progress of specific activities under the 2015-2020 SCMP, demonstrates some progress on specific activities but notes the lack of implementation for others.

Mission. Identify and implement key strategic interventions and priority activities for a country- led robust SC that contributes to the achievement of UHC. Linkages to transformation pillars. If the GOG operates a transparent, well-coordinated SC and infuses innovation with a commitment to reaching self-reliance, then key gains toward UHC will be achieved. To this end, all interventions in this SCMP will be anchored, amongst others, on the following critical transformation pillars: \u2022 Coordination and Collaboration: The SCMP is intended to inspire a spirit of strengthened coordination, collaboration, and cooperation amongst all actors. A well- coordinated SC will ensure that quality essential health commodities are available, accessible, and affordable, furthering the achievement of UHC. Similarly, sustained collaboration and cooperation amongst all stakeholders, including the private sector, are desirable to attain the vision of this SCMP. \u2022 Innovation: The SCMP will deploy innovative SC strategies and interventions that support the MOH\u2019s objectives for UHC and result in an efficient, lean, agile, and sustainable SC from the central level to SDPs. 3 \u2022 Transparency: The SCMP will focus on transparency in terms of roles and responsibilities, procedures, finances, and data across all levels. \u2022 Sustainability: The SCMP will infuse sustainability into each intervention to ensure a strong government-owned and -financed SC that provides available, accessible,"}

These areas are interconnected and will require coordinated interventions to elevate SC performance. Each focus functional area includes an overview of the status quo that is informed by the 2019 NSCA; these build consensus around the current state and enable stakeholders to be forward looking in consequent sections. Then, strategies that align with each transformation pillar are defined to 4 emphasise the importance of focusing on coordination, collaboration, innovation, transparency, and sustainability to drive SC improvements. Next, a competency-based improvement pathway is outlined, summarising the current state and envisioning a 2025 future; it also outlines a high- level strategy, detailed strategic interventions, and annual performance targets to achieve the transformative change the government is stewarding. The competency-based improvement pathways are designed in response to NSCA recommendations; interventions are built in direct response to the current level and desired future state of competencies in each of the 11 technical areas. The interventions are not intended to be exhaustive but to communicate key activities to be undertaken for Ghana\u2019s health SC to transform from the defined current state to the envisioned future state. 3.1 Strategic Planning and Management Maturity Assessment, Progress to Date, Ongoing Challenges The MOH and GHS share strategic planning and management responsibilities in the Ghanaian SC system. The NSCA assessed strategic planning and management capabilities at four central- level facilities: MOH, GHS, the Temporary Central Medical Stores (TCMS), and the Imperial Health Sciences (IHS)-managed warehouse. It also assessed selected regional-level sites: regional hospitals, teaching hospitals, and the RMSs. Central entities had reasonable strategic management and planning capabilities. The"}
{"source_file": "Ghana-Final-Final.pdf", "chunk_id": "Ghana-Final-Final_11", "text": "MOH and GHS had intact SC strategic and implementation plans, and they engaged with the private sector. The MOH and GHS fell short of the recommended 80% capability maturity score, at 67% and 51% respectively. Whilst strategic plans are in place, the use of performance monitoring plans or frameworks to track SC performance is limited. There is room for growth in private sector engagement and coordination; existing engagements, such as the IHS warehouse, are not fully reflective of a private public partnership. The challenge in strategic planning and management stems, in large part, from cross-agency issues: duplication of effort, lack of clarity of roles and authority, limited formal coordination, and an apparent lack of trust. The MOH and GHS have overlapping offices, activities, and tasks in SC activities. Moving forward, in the absence of a Supply Chain Management Agency (SCMA), it will be necessary to harmonise SC responsibilities and to create complementarity in roles and responsibilities among the MOH and agencies. Central-level entities were reported to have greater strategic planning and management capabilities than regional facilities, except the TCMS, which had the lowest capacity. Sub- national strategic planning and monitoring capabilities were limited; 30% of 10 traditional RMSs had SC strategic plans and less than 50% of facilities monitored SC performance. Formal SC risk management plans were rare amongst assessed facilities; most reported risks were financial, human resources, and operational. 5 Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. Because the creation of an overarching body (SCMA) has been deprioritised, the development of harmonised SC responsibilities across agencies is critical to realise coordinated SC leadership and management. To ensure complementarity of the MOH and its agencies\u2019 roles, as well as for well-coordinated strategic planning and management, the MOH will collaborate with its agencies and partners to lead the review and documentation"}

Whilst strategic planning and management are the purview of the MOH and GHS, all other agencies of MOH are responsible for understanding their role in the strategic plans. An overarching priority remains to ensure that all necessary SC functions are fully covered; that existing entities are sufficiently empowered; and that the respective roles, responsibilities, and relationships amongst actors are clearly and universally understood. Innovation. Building on the enhanced data accessibility and visibility, planning and management approaches that are driven by metrics and causation relationships will be deployed. Government stakeholders will maximise use of accurate data and apply lessons learned to improve decision-making and deliver innovative solutions. Transparency. To improve transparency of goals and strategic objectives, the SCMP will be aligned with the activities of all MOH agencies, the private sector, and agencies outside MOH and disseminated to all. The transparency and visibility of SC performance aided by technological advances or innovations in the performance of SC functions by different actors, including the private sector, will sustain the network of relationships between the MOH, its agencies, development partners, and the private sector. Transparency and visibility will build an effective SC relationship and achieve positive SC strategic planning, performance, and data-driven decision-making at all levels. Sustainability.

The goal is a well-coordinated ecosystem of SC actors, including a robust market of private sector entities that is stewarded by the GOG.

This SCMP is an opportunity to re-examine all levels of the SC system and to build political leadership that supports reform. Coordination at a strategic planning and management level is critical for an efficient SC in Ghana. Rather than create an SCMA, which was deprioritised by stakeholders, the SCMP will provide coordinated leadership and governance across MOH and its agencies; the coordination will be reflected in clear guidance regarding functional roles and responsibilities, disseminated to all regions, and reviewed annually.

To improve governance structures and operations according to policy, it will be critical to decentralise interventions and disseminate policies to the sub-national level. Entities outside of the MOH (i.e., civil society organisations, government entities) must be involved to provide external feedback on fairness and equity. Innovation. The innovative path to improving public health in Ghana includes revising policies to reflect changing best practices and onboarding new technologies and solutions. Elevated data use to monitor SC performance should be explored. Innovative areas for governance solutions should be introduced in updated policies for regional- and facility-level drug revolving funds (DRFs) and in processes to monitor policy implementation, including NEML, STGs, and SOPs. Implementation of monitoring by non-MOH entities, such as civil society organisations, should become as important as clear policies, guidelines, and oversight. Transparency.

This wide variability translates into a wide range of the quality of forecasting performance, as well. National quantification guidelines are not employed in entities that conduct forecasting.

Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. Stakeholders will work together to define the most appropriate national-level FASP coordination mechanism. Each of the programs conducts its own quantification. There are differing opinions on continuing this practice or conducting joint FASP because of the unique demands of each program (i.e., Global Fund for malaria grant negotiations, the United States Presidential Malaria Initiative wants quantification to be revised to inform the Malaria Operational Plan). Aligning the timing across commodities may be the most palatable way forward. The SCMP will explore implementing one coordinated quantification cycle and one medium to disseminate FASP for all commodities. Central-level stakeholders will be represented across all programs.

The SCMP will also explore the use of a common forecasting tool across all programs and the viability of harnessing consumption data through GhiLMIS. Transparency. The SCMP recommends onboarding a coordinator at the central level to provide leadership on FASP practices and to coordinate the commodities quantification for all programs, as well as to share final output with all stakeholders. Sustainability. Sustained, high-performing FASP is dependent on the tools and staff capacity. Use of GhiLMIS (for consumption data) and forecasting tools is critical for improved data and sustainability. Capacity of staff at central and regional levels will be built and training rolled out to other SC levels so that FASP tools may be used accurately. 19 Competency-Based Improvement Pathway Current state.

Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. The harmonisation of procurement processes amongst many procurement partners will require extensive partner coordination. Further coordination and collaboration will be needed between key stakeholders to reduce the time for customs clearance. Innovation. eProcurement is an innovative tool to increase efficiency, agility, and transparency. Through SCMP implementation, eProcurement needs to be brought from concept to implementation in the health sector and other GOG ministries. A system (UNIPASS) update will include improving designated officers\u2019 approval processes. The MOH will consider piloting and introducing innovative project management and procurement tracking e-tools that are available at a low cost; these would complement government e-procurement tools. The SCMP will leverage the introduction of the Ghana electronic procurement system (GHANEPS) and encourage system use for procurement activities in the health sector on an incremental basis. Transparency. A rigid action plan for framework contracting has been implemented successfully for essential medicines in the regions. This initiative has inspired high-level cooperation between regions and central health entities, as well as full, transparent outreach to the private sector. The SCMP must build on this momentum to increase procurement transparency for program commodities and to eliminate administrative bottlenecks in tax exemption and custom clearance, reducing average clearing time. 21 Sustainability.

Overall, the IHS warehouse has the strongest performance, measured by the existence of, and its adherence to, storage and inventory management SOPs; adequate physical infrastructure and safety equipment to store commodities; and appropriate security and accountability. Amongst GOG-owned entities, the RMSs had the strongest performance. National SOPs for warehousing and storage exist but are not widely disseminated: Only 6% of CHPS has a copy accessible. Access to SOPs improves at district and regional levels but remains suboptimal. Limited SOPs access limits the opportunity to improve performance and adhere to guidelines. Improvements in specialised storage capabilities are needed urgently, and there is an overall lack of sufficient infrastructure and equipment to optimise warehousing. Storage conditions, especially at lower levels in the system, are subpar; stockouts of key medicines are rampant at all levels. Stock card accuracy issues are pervasive throughout the system. At lower levels, staff understanding of the minimum/maximum levels is inconsistent. An optimise warehouse strategy is available, but it has yet to be implemented. It recommends a one-hub central warehouse with significant cost savings over the status quo. Currently, each level (national and regional) is responsible for its own operational financing. Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. There are two primary issues required for better coordination: 1) lack of a permanent, functional CMS that is empowered as the top of the commodity health SC; and 2) limited coordination between central and regional warehouses.

The MOH will explore the expansion of market entry for capable logistics providers to service the public sector. Transparency. Visibility of SDP functional performance needs to be tracked individually and cumulatively by region to show the overall level of RMS performance. With transparent functional performance and financing data, the overall regional situation can be diagnosed and improved. As financial and operational performance become better linked, performance issues\u2019 root causes will become more transparent. A targeted understanding of warehousing and storage issues will enable stakeholders to develop effective solutions; it also will reveal outliers that are driving down overall regional performance. For example, within each region, data will be applied to reveal whether the lack of on-shelf availability is due to insufficient funds, lack of SOPs, incorrect minimum/maximum levels (due to 24 staff inability), or inadequate storage space; and whether inventory data issues at the regional level are concentrated in a few SDPs or widespread. Sustainability. For sustained improved performance of warehouse operations, the MOH will collaborate with GHS to disseminate SOPs to government- and private sector-operated warehouses and storage areas at central and regional levels. It also will ensure regular performance reviews to improve adherence to SOPs.

Multiple methods are available for waste management; the most predominate is transport to higher-level government facilities (DHAs) or warehouses. There is no clear pathway, however, for reverse logistics in the SC. Further effort and research need to be done to develop an eco- friendly SC that is not detrimental to the environment. Waste management is partially integrated into the LMIS. (Information on what is waste and how it is captured is missing.) The frequency with which lower-level facilities report relying on \u201ctransport to higher facilities\u201d as the main waste management method exceeds the integration of waste management reporting into LMIS. Waste management information is not fully available, and there is a need to capture information on reverse logistics in general, not on waste management in isolation. Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. Focus on the waste management information, working to make it usable and accessible. With increased access to information on waste management, actors along the SC will have a clear idea of who is managing and responsible for which waste, when. Innovation. The SCMP will consider innovative medical packaging; it also will look at chronic disease management and its intersection with waste management and how bulk packaging could decrease costs. Transparency. The SCMP will promote transparency in waste capture, assessment, and transport. It is important to note that what is currently considered waste might not be waste. Increased information will help transparency. The SCMP will look at waste flow visibility and what happens at product expiration, documentation, and regulation. Sustainability. The establishment of institutional and human resource capacity for proper waste management will promote a more eco-friendly, sustainable SC. The MOH will ensure that SC waste is not detrimental to the environment through alternate recycling options. 35 Competency-Based Improvement Pathway Current state.

Future state. Coordinated reverse logistics system for pharmaceutical and health care waste is governed by well-understood policies and best practices. Waste is reported consistently. Pharmaceutical and health care waste management is an active initiative that is not mixed with household waste. Strategy. Through the SCMP, we will review policies and SOPs on specialised waste disposal at all levels, and then improve 1) dissemination to improve implementation at all levels, and 2) budgets to improve the pharmaceutical and health care waste infrastructure at all levels. An active costed implementation plan will be prepared and supported financially by the health sector in the application of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle.

The FDA\u2019s role in waste management must be determined to streamline efforts across entities and SC levels. To conduct reverse logistics, we need to know how waste moves through the system. Activities will include: \u2022 Convene the FDA, local government, environment authorities, and health facilities to understand disposal of their special waste \u2022 Conducting a mapping activity to determine where the waste is sitting and develop a clear understanding of waste processing 3.12 Partnering with The Private Sector Traditionally, health care provision has been the government\u2019s responsibility. However, with governments\u2019 growing fiscal constraints, coupled with the private sector\u2019s growth in expertise and funding, partnership between the public and private sectors has become imperative in most countries, particularly to achieve UHC and reach sustainable development goals. Increased private sector engagement has been driven by public funds\u2019 limitations to cover investment needs, and by efforts to increase public services\u2019 quality and efficiency. There are multiple viable mechanisms by which the GOG and its sub-entities can increase partnerships among global, regional, and local private sector markets, including outsourcing SC functions to private sector providers; acquiring advisory services from private sector firms; and executing PPPs, which typically involve a contract between a public authority and a private counterpart who assumes substantial financial, technical, and operational risk in the project. \u2022 Outsourcing.

In Ghana, the use of private sector 3PLs for commodity distribution has grown as an effective, efficient practice. \u2022 PPPs. PPP schemes for health care investments traditionally envisage a Project-Build- Operate-Transfer (PBOT). PPPs can be explored for a variety of initiatives, including to support long-term infrastructural investment, such as building a warehouse or hospital. \u2022 Advisory services. Technical assistance in SC best practices or advisory services \u2014 such as SC design, needs quantification, or LMIS design \u2014 can be accessed through contracts or partnerships with regional and local private sector firms.

The profit-driven approach of most private sector firms can spur operational efficiency but must be kept in check to ensure the quality and integrity of products and services. The MOH will ensure that each partnership with the private sector has a demonstrable value-addition and that effective implementation mechanisms are in place to attain objectives of all partnership parties.

Strategically, the MOH will create an enabling environment to spur the private sector to invest in the SC in Ghana whilst ensuring value for money and a win-win for all partners. Maturity Assessment: Progress to Date and Ongoing Challenges There exists interaction (communication), dialogue (cooperation on mutual interest), and agreement (joint contract design and implementation) between the private sector and the public sector on health needs in Ghana. Private sector actors play a complementary role on health commodity supplies. The private sector uses national data of health commodities consumption to plan support to the public health system. Private sector engagements have provided increased access to skills, expertise, investment, and innovation; improvement in operational efficiencies; shared risk; and improved availability of health commodities. Major financial arrangements between private and public sector actors through the NHIS tariff regime have increased financing of health commodity SCs, but the integration of the private actor\u2019s information systems into the public health LMIS has been minimal. 38 Some challenges to be addressed include: \u2022 Data disparities and difficulties in aggregation because private actors use sales data to plan health commodity supplies, whilst the public sector uses consumption data. \u2022 Short contract length, which limits local private actors\u2019 desire to participate in health commodities supply. \u2022 Misalignment of performance metrics of expected outcomes in the delivery of health commodities. \u2022 Unfavorable payment terms from bureaucracy and budgetary challenges in the public sector. \u2022"}

Linkage to Transformation Pillars Coordination and collaboration. The SCMP will incorporate effective coordination and collaboration between private and public sector stakeholders. It is important to note that the focus of the engagement is to generate increased availability, affordability, and effective and efficient use of health commodities. This is expected to lead to greater access to skills and expertise, operational efficiencies, access to capital investment, innovation, and shared risk. Innovation. The focus will be on improving performance through novel and locally relevant solutions for sourcing, warehouse configuration, and information technology. The integration of GhiLMIS with private sector enterprise systems will increase the visibility of health commodities supply across the country. The adoption of innovative operating models (including network optimisation and redesign of transport loops) for last-mile distribution will help increase access to health commodities. The creation of health commodities desks in existing banks will provide tailored support for health commodities SC financing. Transparency. Increasing the level of trust will result in a successful partnership and collaboration between private and public sector partners. A high degree of openness and increased willingness to dialogue, interact, and engage with stakeholders in the private sector will help boost confidence and trust in any public-private collaboration. 39 Sustainability.

The revised Supply Chain Master Plan (SCMP) 2025-2029 represents our renewed commitment to ensuring the uninterrupted availability of essential health commodities at the last mile while also addressing unforeseen health emergencies and disruptions. The 2015-2020 SCMP, developed in 2015, systematically addressed challenges in Ghana\u2019s public health SC, outlined objectives for the future, and proposed critical interventions. Over its implementation period, notable achievements were realized, including progress in developing national policies, guidelines, and standard operating procedures (SOPs); scheduled last mile deliveries (LMD) to service delivery points (SDPs); and the design and rollout of the Ghana Integrated Logistics Management Information System (GhiLMIS). Following the expiration of the SCMP 2015- 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH), with support from its agencies and partners, developed the SCMP 2021-2025. This plan was intended to build on the successes of its predecessor. However, the timeline for its development was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in its finalization in 2022. Implementation of key activities began in 2023, but many strategic interventions and activities are still pending. As a result, the SCMP 2021-2025 has been revised, and its implementation timeline extended to 2029. The revised plan, SCMP 2025-2029, aims"}

STRATEGIC PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT This SCMP is an opportunity to re-examine all levels of the SC system and to build political leadership that supports reform. Moving forward, in the absence of a Supply Chain Management Agency, it will be necessary to harmonise SC responsibilities and to create complementarity in roles and responsibilities among the MOH and agencies. The goal is a well-coordinated ecosystem of SC actors, including a robust market of private sector entities that is stewarded by the GOG. An overarching priority remains to ensure that all necessary SC functions are fully covered; those existing entities"}

The SCMP will promote coordinated leadership and governance across MOH and its agencies; reflected in clear guidance regarding functional roles and responsibilities, disseminated to all regions. POLICY AND GOVERNANCE The SCMP will lay the framework to implement strong accountability and governance structures to hold agencies and the private sector accountable for performance. More inclusive policies and stronger governance structures will promote sustainability by bringing in more local actors (private sector, civil society) and inform proper resource allocation. Enhanced coordination according to clear policy and governance structures will strengthen existing linkages. The SCMP strategy will focus on decentralising governance of vertical SCs to the regions whilst transitioning the central level to conduct intensive supportive supervision in which regions are held accountable based on performance scorecards. It will enhance the supportive supervision role of the central level over the regions through the implementation of a performance management framework. HUMAN RESOURCES Opportunities for SC-specific capacity building exist, as the presence of dedicated and professionally trained SC personnel is most significant at the highest levels of the public health system and lacking at lower levels. Capacity development must occur at multiple levels (e.g., individual, organisational, societal) and across sectors (public, commercial, civil society) to be successful. The SCMP will aim to standardise SC capacity development at all levels and introduce a Continuing Professional Development program for SC personnel.

In 2011, the Ministry of Health and its agencies decided to transform the public health supply chain through the development of a Supply Chain Master Plan (SCMP 2012). This was revised to become the SCMP 2015-2020 which systematically identified challenges in Ghana\u2019s public health supply chain, outlined objectives for the future, and proposed numerous interventions. Since then, there has been considerable progress in"}

Today, several original recommendations from the SCMP 2015-2020 remain pertinent, underscored by updated data on the current situation of Ghana\u2019s public health SC system. A review of the interventions (February 2020) revealed significant progress in SC performance objectives in the health sector, specifically: \u2022 The scheduled delivery of commodities from the RMSs to 100% of SDPs (regional hospitals, district hospitals, polyclinics, and health centres) was attained. \u2022 A warehousing strategy to optimize commodity management and distribution was developed but could not be fully implemented. \u2022 A framework contracting mechanism was developed for high-value, high-volume, and critical lifesaving commodities to benefit from economies of scale and assured quality. \u2022 An integrated logistics management information system (LMIS) that captures, analyses, and reports on SC data for decision making was developed and rolled out. \u2022 Mechanisms have been put in place to ensure SC coordination at the regional level by operationalizing SC coordinating committees. 2 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) These achievements notwithstanding, implementation of the SCMP 2015-2020 faced numerous challenges, from the inability of the MOH to establish an autonomous agency for SC oversight to limited funding for SC activities across all levels. Following its expiration the MOH, supported by its agencies and partners, developed the SCMP 2021-2025. A key task of the new strategy was to reconsider the priorities outlined in the SCMP 2015-2020 according to the current SC capabilities and performance and, crucially, in the context of management, leadership, priorities, economic, and political realities. The timeline for completing the SCMP 2021-2025 was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to its finalization in 2022. Implementation of key activities commenced in 2023 with the Monitoring"}

This extension aims to ensure the successful execution of key tasks, while also optimizing resource allocation and effort, which would otherwise be expended in developing an entirely new SCMP. Additionally, the revision will provide an opportunity to incorporate interventions that enhance the adaptability and responsiveness of the SCMP to emerging public health threats, such as COVID-19, MPOX, and other potential diseases to ensure the supply chain is better equipped to respond swiftly and effectively to future health emergencies. 3 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) NATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN ASSESSMENT The National Supply Chain Assessment (NSCA) established the presence or absence of key capabilities across eleven (11) functional areas at all facility levels and assessed key performance indicators (KPIs). The NSCA 2019, in assessing the progress of specific activities under the SCMP 2015-2020, demonstrated some progress on specific activities but noted the lack of implementation for others. Most notable of these is the decision not to create a centralised agency or authority to manage the SC.

An additional functional area focusing on private sector partnership has been included to leverage private sector resources and expertise. These areas are interconnected and will require coordinated interventions to enhance SC performance. Each focus functional area includes a current status overview referencing the NSCA 2019 and a 2024 review of the implementation status of the SCMP 2021-2025 to establish consensus on the present state and to enable stakeholders to be forward-looking in subsequent sections.

The NSCA assessed strategic planning and management capabilities at the national level. MOH, GHS, the Temporary Central Medical Stores (TCMS), and DP World previously called the Imperial Health Sciences (IHS)-managed warehouse. It also assessed selected regional- level sites: regional hospitals, teaching hospitals, and the RMSs. Central entities had reasonable strategic management and planning capabilities. The MOH and GHS had intact SC strategic and implementation plans, and they engaged with the private sector. The MOH and GHS fell short of the recommended 80% capability maturity score, at 67% and 51% respectively. Whilst strategic plans are in place, the use of performance monitoring plans or frameworks to track SC performance is limited. There is room for growth in private sector engagement and coordination; existing engagements, such as the IHS warehouse, are not fully reflective of a private-public partnership. The challenge in strategic planning and management stems, in large part, from cross-agency issues: duplication of effort, lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities, limited formal coordination, and an apparent lack of trust. Moving forward, in the absence of a Supply Chain Management Agency (SCMA), it will be necessary to harmonise SC responsibilities and to create complementarity in roles and responsibilities among the MOH and its agencies. Central-level entities were reported to have greater strategic planning and management capabilities than regional facilities. Three (3) out of the 10 traditional RMSs had SC strategic plans and less than 50%"}

To ensure complementarity of the MOH and its agencies\u2019 roles, as well as for well-coordinated strategic planning and management, the MOH will collaborate with its agencies and partners to lead the review and documentation of roles and responsibilities for each SC agency, including the private sector and other government agencies. An overarching priority remains to ensure that; all necessary SC functions are fully covered; existing entities are sufficiently empowered; and that the respective roles, responsibilities and relationships amongst actors are clearly and universally understood. Innovation Building on the enhanced data accessibility and visibility, planning and management approaches that are driven by metrics and causation relationships will be deployed. Government stakeholders will maximise the use of accurate data and apply lessons learned to improve decision-making and deliver innovative solutions. Transparency To improve the transparency of goals and strategic objectives, the SCMP will be aligned with the activities of all MOH agencies, the private sector, and other related government agencies and disseminated to all.

This is resulting from an existent overarching strategy of non-complementary roles and responsibilities across key agencies, as well as insufficient risk management protocol, and engagement of the private sector. Future State The goal is a well-coordinated ecosystem of SC actors, including a robust market of private sector entities that is stewarded by the GOG.

As financial and operational performance become better linked, performance issues\u2019 root causes will become more transparent. A targeted understanding of warehousing and storage issues will enable stakeholders to develop effective solutions; it also will reveal outliers that are driving down overall performance. For example, within each region, data will be applied to reveal whether the lack of on-shelf availability is due to insufficient funds, lack of SOPs, incorrect minimum/maximum levels (due to staff inability), or inadequate storage space; and whether inventory data issues at the regional level are concentrated in a few SDPs or widespread. Sustainability For sustained improved performance of warehouse operations, the MOH will collaborate with GHS to disseminate SOPs to public and private sector-operated warehouses and storage areas at central, regional, and health facilities. It also will ensure regular performance reviews to improve adherence to SOPs. The use of the private sector as a viable source of warehousing for public sector commodities will also enhance operational efficiency. 33 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) COMPETENCY-BASED IMPROVEMENT PATHWAY Current"}

Future State By 2029, warehousing and storage performance will be consistently monitored by standardised KPIs across all levels. Commodities will see constant stock turnover (consistent, frequent stock cycles) according to minimum/maximum levels with resultant cost benefits. It is envisaged that, in the next five years, there will exist a standardised, modern warehousing infrastructure at all levels. Regional warehouses will be established and operationalized in all the new regions. To ensure Good Warehousing Practice (GWP), central and regional warehouses will be FDA accredited. Strategy To achieve this desired future state, the MOH will invest in physical and human capacity to bring all warehouses at central, regional, and SDP levels to Ghana FDA standards. It also will ensure that SOPs and other tools are prepared to international practice levels and implemented by well-trained commodity managers.

There exists interaction dialogue and agreement between the private sector and the public sector on health needs in Ghana. Private sector actors play a complementary role on health commodity supplies. Private sector engagements have provided increased access to skills, expertise, investment, and innovation; improvement in operational efficiencies; shared risk; and improved availability of health commodities. Major financial arrangements between private and public sector actors through the NHIS tariff regime have increased financing of health commodity SCs. However, integrating the private actor\u2019s information systems into the public health LMIS has been minimal. The health commodity supply chain faces significant challenges that impede its efficiency. These challenges include disparities in data usage between the private and public sectors, short contract lengths, unfavourable payment terms, and rising supply costs due to uncontrolled tariffs. These issues result in difficulties in accurate demand forecasting, reduced supplier participation, financial uncertainty, and escalating prices, all of which compromise the availability and affordability of health 50 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) commodities. In addition, the Lack of stringent regulatory systems from under-resourced regulatory agencies leads to the distribution of substandard products, further undermining public health and trust in the system. Furthermore, the private sector supply chain is burdened by inadequate technical training for supply chain management, poor warehousing and distribution infrastructure, and challenges accessing financing for private suppliers. The lack of integrated enterprise systems exacerbates these problems, resulting in fragmented and inefficient supply chain operations. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach, including improving data integration, revising financial and contractual policies, strengthening regulatory oversight, enhancing training, and upgrading infrastructure to ensure a resilient and efficient health commodity supply chain. 51 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) LINKAGE"}

It is important to note that the focus of the engagement is to generate increased availability, affordability, and effective and efficient use of health commodities. This is expected to lead to greater access to skills and expertise, operational efficiencies, access to capital investment, innovation, and shared risk. Innovation The focus will be on improving performance through novel and locally relevant solutions for sourcing, warehouse configuration, and information technology. The integration of GhiLMIS with private sector enterprise systems will increase the visibility of health commodities supply across the entire health supply chain. The adoption of innovative operating models (including network optimisation and redesign of transport loops) for last-mile distribution will help increase access to health commodities. The creation of health commodities desks in existing banks will provide tailored support for health commodities SC financing. Transparency Increasing the level of trust will result in a successful partnership and collaboration between private and public sector partners. A high degree of openness and increased willingness to dialogue, interact, and engage with stakeholders in the private sector will help boost confidence and trust in any public-private collaboration. The integration of LMIS with the private sector enterprise system will increase the visibility of health commodities supply across the entire health supply chain. Sustainability Effective collaborative planning between public and private sector actors will boost the sustainability of health commodities SCs. This partnership and collaboration must be based on mutual trust and shared benefits. Private stakeholders must receive their due as and when required to guarantee the continuity of support and collaboration. 52 GHANA HEALTH SUPPLY CHAIN MASTER PLAN (2025-2029) COMPETENCY-BASED IMPROVEMENT PATHWAY Current State The private sector does not have adequate capability (financial, expertise, and infrastructure)"}

While maintaining certain strategic interventions from the previous plan, some have been omitted, others revised, and new interventions introduced to align with current priorities and relevance. The SCMP 2025-2029 is developed in collaboration with SC sector stakeholders. If the GOG implements these strategic interventions to transform the Ghanaian public health SC into a transparent, well-coordinated SC that infuses innovation with a commitment to reaching self-reliance, then it will achieve key gains toward UHC. Successful implementation will require the commitment of the GOG, its agencies, the donor community, and all health sector stakeholders. Implementation will be monitored and evaluated according to annual performance targets for each programmatic area.

These concerns have been raised on both social and political platforms over the years and have underpinned key policy directives in the health sector particularly in recent times. The extent to which stakeholders hold the health sector accountable in the context of these concerns have also increased over time. This is partly due to the increasing levels of investments in the health sector and the need to show more precisely commensurate achievements and benefits to vulnerable groups in particular. On account of these developments performance measurement has become a critical management endeavor in the health sector. Performance measurement has influenced and exerted pressure on global demands for information. The need to show progress towards the achievement of the MDGs, the move by health partners from SWAPs to MDBS and the increasing need for both multilateral and bilateral donors to demonstrate their contribution towards health development has also created increased demand for information. New developments in technology, including the use of the Internet and other modes of communication for the purpose of providing and managing healthcare services have also had an effect in Ghana. Though not to the extent seen in developed countries improvements in technology have greatly facilitated the flow of information amongst the providers and recipients of healthcare services. However the health sector remains far behind in taking advantage of such developments to improve reporting. Performance is grossly under reported with notable exclusion of key providers in the private and quasi government sectors, developments to improve information managements lags behind other sector improvement activities, the whole culture of information generation and"}

In the light of such developments, new issues arise in the context of the regulation by law of information generation and reporting in the health sector. Globally, there has been a move towards evolving a legal framework that can address the new issues arising from the use of information technology in the healthcare sector. Two of the most important issues that arise in this context are the right to privacy of individuals, and the protection of this right in relation to health information and the development of suitable standards for regulating the provision of healthcare services by the use of technology. Proper regulation of the creation and use of healthcare information is imperative and has been a matter of special concern to governments as well as other public bodies involved in the field of healthcare. These concerns cover two important, yet sometimes competing goals. The first is the need to gather and disseminate accurate and timely information on the incidence and prevalence of diseases, assessment of healthcare and public health needs and evaluation of programs, services, institutions and providers. Secondly, there is also the need to protect that information from uses or disclosures that can cause harm particularly to individuals to whom the information pertains. This report examines the legal framework relevant to the creation and use of health information in Ghana. It is also written as the basis for the drafting of a comprehensive legislation governing reporting in the health sector. 2 DEFINITIONS USED IN THIS REPORT \u201cHealthcare Provider\u201d includes doctors, hospitals, and all other individuals or institutions involved in the provision of healthcare, and any other person furnishing healthcare services or supplies. \u201cHealth Information\u201d means any information, whether oral or recorded in any"}

Information on clinical care and public health services measure output, outcome and impact of curative, preventive and promotional services. The focus is on demographic data, diseases and health status and service utilisation information in priority areas. 3 Financial management information measures the financial input into the health system. It provides basic accounting information to enable the measurement of costs in delivering the service package and other essential non-clinical activities. Accountability and efficiency is the main motive behind reporting in this area. Human resource information provides an understanding of staffing patterns, movement and training requirements for effective delivery of services. The integrated payroll and personnel data system contains information on labour mix at each level and relates this to the human resource standards for health service delivery. Information on drugs and logistics management measures utilisation and stock management information including data for assessing rational use of medicines. The other components of the logistics information system provide information on infrastructure, equipment and other capital inputs and allow for planning and budgeting for maintenance and replacement. Information in the health sector is organised along these components for each level and for each Budget and Management Centre. However for the purposes of reporting, a minimum set of indicators, the Sector-wide Indicators, have been identified and formats for reporting have been introduced to enable data to be submitted to higher levels. Within each Budget and Management Centre data collection and information organisation is based on information demands appropriate for each level. The Health Services in Ghana is organised at five levels namely community, sub- district, district, regional and national levels. Services provided at the community, sub-district and district levels constitute primary health services delivered in the context of a district health system. Services to communities are delivered through outreach programmes"}

Other services available to the communities are those offered by traditional birth attendants, chemical sellers and itinerant herbalists. The sub-district level provides clinical, public health and maternity services through the sub-district management team. This team is required to forge a close partnership with the communities through community institutions, community based health workers and other health related institutions in their catchment area. The Sub-district health team is responsible for the overall planning, monitoring and evaluation of services as well as ensuring quality of services within the sub-district. The planning responsibility of the sub-district health team requires that they have access to information on health needs, service delivery, coverage and resource availability. The district level is responsible for operational planning and programme implementation and is organised under clinical, public health and administrative units. Clinical services are provided by the hospitals in the district while public health activities are managed by the district health management team which is also responsible for planning, organising, monitoring and evaluation of the package of services at the district level. At the district level health status information is an aggregation of service outputs of all the service delivery structures at the sub-district level, the district hospitals and other private providers. District specific information on financial, human resource, drugs and supplies, estate, transport and equipment is generated at this level. Some 4 districts have research centres that produce significant non-routine information on the district health services. The Region is responsible for strategic planning and it monitors performance of district and regional hospitals. Its main role is that of advisory and the provision of technical support. The current structure of the regional health administration includes the Public Health Unit, Clinical Care Unit and the Regional Health Administration"}

Some regions have additional structures including training and diagnostic facilities. The regional health administration assesses needs, analyses trends, provides in-service training and offers technical support to districts. Supervision, monitoring and conducting operational research on key problems are also part of the main responsibilities of regions. Information management at the regional level is centred around the two primary sources of information namely the districts and the regional hospitals. Data collected at this level facilitates the assessment of performance of these management units and provides scope for assessing trends and doing comparative analysis. At the national level, information requires more in-depth analysis to enable the development of policies and standards for health care delivery. Again, it is at this level that outcome and impact of policy is determined indicating the need for a much wider scope of information analysis. The Regions and other tertiary facilities are the primary sources of information at the national level. The Ministry of Health in focusing on sector-wide policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation also uses information from other sectors to enable it play its role in initiating legislation and promoting inter-sectoral collaboration in support of health objectives. THE PROBLEM The system described above comes with a number of challenges. Firstly, there is a proliferation of data collection tools most of which have been developed by the public sector for the management of public sector information. A number of these forms have their origins in programmes developed and executed solely by the public sector with minimal or no engagement with other health care providers.

Secondly, the lack of requisite skills at the lower levels coupled with a perception of non-usefulness of information and data collected at the lower levels have conspired to create an exceptionally low level of commitment from health providers. Programme focused strategies receive more support and recognition as a result of the lack of commitment. This has led to difficulties in coordination since programmes have differing priorities and the ultimate is to justify the use of resources put at their disposal. However the major challenge seems to be the lack of dependence on evidence for accountability within the health sector. At the various levels funding and other resources are made available even if managers fail to report adequately on 5 performance. These challenges underscore the need to improve the policy and regulatory environment and to define a legal framework for information management and reporting in the health sector. The nature of health information and medical records allows details of individual records to be captured as part of the overall statistics. The management of this primary source of information goes a long way in protecting the individual and allows informed decisions to be made at the management level. Inaccuracies in the information, or its improper disclosure, can affect an individual\u2019s dignity and especially where a third party is involved (such as the NHIS) can lead to problems in the contractual arrangements for service delivery. At the same time, accurate and comprehensive Health Information is critical to the quality of healthcare delivery pathway and to the physician-patient relationship.

EXISTING LAWS ON HEALTH REPORTING IN GHANA A total of \u2026legal instruments related to health care delivery were reviewed. These included \u2026new laws being drafted as a result of steps to improve the organization of health services in the country. For the purposes of this review, the team agreed to categorize reporting in the health sector as follows: \u00a7 Management reporting which authorizes organizations concerned to submit periodic reports on their activities as mandated by the law. \u00a7 Activity reporting with the potential of generating a database on the routine activities of the organizations (provide information on patient contacts). \u00a7 Activity reporting that generates written reports on the activities of the organization. The team observed that out of the seventeen legal instruments reviewed six had no reporting provisions falling into any of the three categories above. Of particular interest was the Private Hospitals and Maternity Homes Act which had no provision at all for reporting. The Nurses and Midwives decree, the Pharmacy Act and the Nurses Regulation similarly had no provisions for reporting. Most of the instruments, including the Ghana Health Service and Teaching Hospitals Act, that had reporting provisions fell into the management reporting category. The laws provided for annual reporting on activities and programmes to either their respective councils or to the In Ghana it is a common practice for the news media to carry advertisements and to solicit assistance for unfortunate individuals by publicizing their medical problems extensively. Such practice, even though has good intentions further robs the patient of his or her privacy and sometimes dignity. 6 Minister of Health. In almost all of these the emphasis was"}

Most of the other reporting requirements deal with the third category and were in respect of monitoring activities under the mandate of the organizations involved. The Medical Profession Regulation and the Infectious Diseases, Cap 78 were the only instruments that made provisions for reporting based on patient contact. In the Case of the Medical Profession Regulation, the aim was to ensure patient privacy by requesting for the patients consent before information obtained in the course of the patient-doctor professional relationship could be disclosed. However the same law requires a practitioner to disclose such information in the public interest when required to do so by the court of law. The Infectious Diseases, Cap 78 is directed to the public to report selected diseases in outbreak situation to health personnel. The obvious aim is to help in the management of epidemics by ensuring rapid response to outbreaks. The Private Health Sector Policy provides provision for data collection and information management, however the policy directs the regional and district directors of health services to maintain a database of private practitioners in their areas of jurisdiction. It also indicates that the Ministry of Health will develop tools for data collection and will enforce mandatory reporting and feedback. What is not clear in the policy is whether data collection will be done by public sector operatives in private facilities or whether private facilities were under obligation to report. The team observed that none of the laws was explicit on any incentive or sanctions as a means of ensuring that the reports are generated and reported as required. It also observed the following: \u00a7 None of the service providers were required to report on their routine clinical activities. \u00a7 The private sector was not obliged to submit any report to"}

Indeed there was no clear relationship between private facilities and the health management units at any level. \u00a7 Management at all levels except the national level has some reporting responsibility specified in the laws. \u00a7 In places where some reporting requirements have been made, the Minister of Health has been identified as the recipient, however in a number of cases this was not clearly spelt out. \u00a7 None of the laws examined addressed the necessary infrastructure and systems to be set up to facilitate reporting. 7 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK The attempt to improve the policy and legal environment is to ensure that reported health sector information describes as completely and as accurately as possible the health and health systems status of the country. The main objective is to streamline the ethics of reporting health information within and across the levels of health administration in the country. Specifically, the framework will: \u00a7 Guide the development of internal structures for the collection, storage and reporting of health data and health information. \u00a7 Specify the type and content of data to be reported by all providers in Ghana. \u00a7 Define responsibilities and reporting mechanism and schedules to be applied to all health data. \u00a7 Define situations and the extent to which Health Information can or must be disclosed to patients, Healthcare Providers, government and other stakeholders, and where the use of Health Information must be authorized. \u00a7 Prevent abuse of Health Information and establish penalties for misuse. \u00a7 Safeguard privacy of Health Information by the use of identifiers for Healthcare Providers. PROVISIONS OF PROPOSED LEGAL FRAMEWORK The provisions outlined seek to provide first and foremost a definition of the subject matter of the proposed legal framework. In this context, Health Information is broadly defined to include"}

By this definition health information in the Ghanaian setting can be classified broadly under information for patient management, information for facility management and information for health systems management. Another set of classification which the team discussed was clinical information, public health information and administrative information. The team agreed to link the two classifications loosely by putting patient and clinical information together, facility and health systems information to be put There is a continuing debate under the National Health Insurance Scheme on the need for diagnosis and treatment provided to subscribers to be disclosed as part of the requirements for processing claims from providers. There are also proposals for patient identity cards to include magnetic strips that will contain personal and health information of patients. The legal and ethical implications need to be examined extensively since patient privacy can easily be violated. 8 together as administrative information and public health information to represent information that relate to populations within specified geographic areas. Although this has proven difficult to implement under agreed administrative guidelines, the framework seeks to provide sanctions for improper possession, brokering, disclosure, or sale of Health Information. Particularly where a provider fails to comply with privacy standards prescribed by law or knowingly violates patient privacy, obtains protected Health Information under false pretenses. The proposal establishes basic structures and rules about information practices which will lead to the creation of databases at management levels within the health sector. The existing laws and regulations in Ghana do not adequately address concerns relating to Health Information.

To do this the region receives reports and information from all Budget and Management Centers within the region. These are the Districts Health Administration, the Regional Hospitals, Health Training Institutions, and Regional (Reference) Laboratories.

Application and use of information technology The use of information and communication technology in the health sector is aimed at the simplification of administrative processes and the reduction in data gathering and processing costs. It is also to facilitate the delivery of health related information to remote locations within the sector. The application of information technology in the health sector is of paramount importance to align the multiple stakeholders towards a common reporting mechanism and objective. The starting point is to address a number of constraints plaguing the health industry in Ghana. First is the lack of policies and legislations to protect privacy while permitting critical analytic uses of health data, the lack of uniform, multipurpose data standards that meet the needs of the diverse groups that record and use health information, and a workforce that lacks understanding of Health Informatics. In this regard the aim of the legal framework will be to define a robust system for the use of information technology to capture, store and exchange health information in an environment supported by systems that will bring administrative simplification and improve patient care services by providing a continuum"}

As the use of information technology and the exchange of electronic health information increases, concerns about the protection of personal health information exchanged electronically within a 13 nationwide health information network will also increase.

The purposes for which health data is collected needs to be clear. \u00a7 Disclosure to Third Parties Since medical data is sensitive, and since a duty of confidence generally applies to data which a health care professional gathers in the course of his relationship with a patient, it is necessary to regard health care data as being unavailable to third parties in the absence of a clear and authoritative reason. In the case of a referral care is needed to ensure that only relevant parts of the patient's history are communicated. \u00a7 Data Access by Subjects The principle of data ownership is to appreciate that, while the records (the documents or disks) are unequivocally the property of the practitioner or institution, the data is not. Data is not capable of being owned, and many different people have an interest in it, including and especially the person to whom it relates. 14 \u00a7 Record Transfer Although records are owned by their originator, a patient has a very real interest in having them, or at least an accurate representation of their contents, transferred to his new health care professional. The practice of transferring records when an appropriately documented request is made is therefore highly desirable from a treatment viewpoint. \u00a7 Record Destruction Patient history is one of the relatively few classes of record for which some genuine justification exists for long-term retention However the volume of information which is generated becomes very large, and much of it does become irrelevant over time, and hence periodic summarisation and destruction of old material should be aimed at.

The framework aims to take the healthcare information system from an information gathering entity and data processing set up to knowledge management systems for improved decision-making. This requires that the multiple stakeholders work towards a common objective which is to deliver information to individuals, providers and planners, when and where they need, to make available information required to aid and support decision making for health and healthcare. The team proposes two options for the way forward. The first is to build consensus on the proposed framework and to align with the currents efforts at redefining the health sector laws. In this case the provisions outlined in this report will be considered in the drafting of the Legislative Instruments supporting the laws. This may be some time away. The other option is to transform this proposal into a bill and work towards the enactment of a comprehensive law on health reporting in Ghana. The multi sectoral issues at stake and the sensitivity of some of the provisions make this a preferred option."}

It describes interrelationships within the health sector. It is aimed at ensuring effective achievement of the Health Sector Medium Term Development Plan (HSMTDP 2022-2025). The CMA is guided by sector legislations, mandate, policies and procedures as well as key developments in the international and national aid architecture as reflected in the current National Medium Term Policy Framework, the revised National Health Policy (NHP, 2020), the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Roadmap for Ghana (2020-2030), as well as other Global Policy environments. Under the guidance of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), the Ministry of Health together with other MDAs developed a new HSMTDP for the period 2022-2025). The HSMTDP is aligned to the current National Medium-Term Development Policy Framework (2022-2025), which is developed with a view to improving the living standards of people in Ghana. While the HSMTDP 2022-2025 sets out the direction for the sector for the next four years in terms of policy and key implementation strategies, the CMA 2022-2025 focuses on the collaboration arrangements, which need to be in place in the sector for the policies outlined in the HSMTDP to be"}

The revision is borne out of consultative meetings of all relevant stakeholders involved in malaria case management in the country. This document is written in very simple and precise language to make it easy for everyone to read and understand. I implore all stakeholders and health professionals to ensure that the guidelines contained in this document are complied with both in the Private and Public sectors in order to ensure effective treatment of malaria and reduce the malaria burden in our country. It is my hope that, the New Malaria Treatment Policy will form the basis for the standardization of the management of all types of malaria throughout the country as it supports the new paradigm of creating wealth through health.

Consequently, the country drew up a 'Medium Term Strategic Plan for Malaria Control in Ghana' (1998-2002), which sought to improve the coverage of malaria control activities by adopting an inter-sectoral approach involving and promoting partnership with the private sector and the community. It has also committed itself to the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa, which similarly seeks to achieve specific targets on malaria prevention and control. In spite of these initiatives, Malaria remains hyper endemic in Ghana and is the single most important cause of mortality and morbidity especially among children under five years, pregnant women and the poor. Apart from the health consequences, malaria puts a heavy burden on productivity and hence economic development. In Ghana, Malaria is estimated to cause the loss of about 10.6% Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) costing an equivalent of up to 6% of GDP annually in economic burden. Therefore, the GPRS II identifies malaria control as one of the key health sector interventions. ANTI-MALARIA DRUG POLICY FOR GHANA 2 MINISTRY OF HEALTH In Ghana, as well as globally, malaria control programmes are threatened by the development of drug resistance to mono therapies necessitating revisions of treatment policies. In this regard, in 2002 Ghana initiated the process of using ACTs following WHO recommendations for all countries experiencing resistance to mono-therapies in the treatment of falciparum malaria. Based on evidence of efficacy, compliance, side effects, cost effectiveness, impact on local industry and"}

However, the implementation process was faced with challenges such as adverse drug reactions, lack of other treatment options and safety concerns. It has therefore become necessary to review the drug policy and address all identified concerns. A team commissioned by the Minister of Health was tasked to review existing policy guidelines and select additional ACT drugs and dosage forms to cater for those who for one reason or another, cannot tolerate Artesunate- Amodiaquine. Two additional ACTs namely; Artemether- Lumefantrine and Dihydroartemisinin/Piperaquine were selected. Nevertheless, Artesunate-Amodiaquine still remains the preferred ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. ANTI-MALARIA DRUG POLICY FOR GHANA 3 MINISTRY OF HEALTH This document is thus a revision of the 2004 anti-malarial policy and provides policy measures and an implementation framework for the treatment of malaria. Malaria is a major cause of illness and death in Ghana, particularly among children and pregnant women in Ghana. In 2006, malaria accounted for 38.6% of all outpatient illnesses and 36.9% of all admissions. Malaria prevalence per thousand population was 171 and 2,835 malaria-attributable deaths (all ages) representing 19% of all deaths were recorded. Infection rates are high in children peaking at more than 80% in those aged 5 - 9 years and falling to low levels in adults. Malaria infection during pregnancy causes maternal anaemia and placental parasitemia both of which are responsible for miscarriages and low birth weight babies among pregnant women. As many as 13.7% of all admissions of pregnant women in 2006, was as a result of malaria whilst 9.0% of them died from the disease. Case Management has been and continues to be one"}

Treatment is generally presumptive and cases of fever are first treated as malaria with the recommended anti-malaria drug. However, the effectiveness of this intervention is highly dependent on anti-malarials, which should not only be safe and effective, but also available, affordable and BACKGROUND/SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS ANTI-MALARIA DRUG POLICY FOR GHANA 4 MINISTRY OF HEALTH acceptable to the population at risk. The rational use of an effective anti-malarial not only reduces the risk of severe disease and death and shortens the duration of the illness, but also contributes to slowing down the development of the parasite's resistance. In Ghana as well as worldwide, the emergence and rapid spread of P. falciparum resistance to commonly used anti- malarials such as chloroquine poses a serious challenge to the benefits of early diagnosis and prompt treatment as a priority within the current strategy for malaria control efforts. In November 2000, an informal Consultation on the use of anti-malaria drugs was convened by W.H.O. in Geneva. The meeting reviewed and updated recommendations on the use of anti-malaria drugs for chemoprophylaxis and treatment, based on the information available. The potential value of malaria therapy using combinations of drugs was identified as a strategic and viable option in improving efficacy and delaying development and selection of resistant parasites. In this regard, the National Malaria Control Programme in collaboration with the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research studied the efficacy of chloroquine country wide in 2002 and found that treatment failure following chloroquine was in the range between 6% and 25% and parasite clearance rates were low and in some ANTI-MALARIA DRUG POLICY FOR GHANA 5 MINISTRY OF HEALTH cases below 50% (fig 2 & 3). These results prompted the search for alternative treatment for uncomplicated malaria."}

A task force was also formed to review the situation and the available data on malaria including the malaria morbidity and mortality trends, quality of anti-malaria drugs on the market, socio-economic aspects of malaria, cost effectiveness of proposed new treatment and the problem of malaria in pregnancy. After several deliberations, the task force recommended the use of Artesunate - Amodiaquine combination for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Thus in 2004, Ghana changed its anti-malaria drug policy selecting Artesunate-Amodiaquine combination as the first line drug for the management of uncomplicated malaria. The introduction was set for 1st January, 2005 but roll out was later in that year. Systems were put in place to monitor the efficacy, quality, adverse drug reaction as well as G6PD status of pregnant women (with respect to the adoption of Sulphadoxine - Pyrimethamine for Intermittent Preventive Treatment {IPT}). ANTI-MALARIA DRUG POLICY FOR GHANA 6 MINISTRY OF HEALTH The introduction of Artesunate - Amodiaquine combination was however not without problems. One of the major problems that the programme faced was the management of negative press reports of adverse events which nearly derailed the programme. Continuous monitoring of the efficacy in the age group with the largest proportion of malaria problem - children under 5 years - pointed to the possibility of differences in drug responses between adults and children. Nonetheless, the efficacy of Artesunate - Amodiaquine has remained high and currently is over 90% after 28 days of treatment. (Fig 1). Recent results from ten sentinel sites monitoring the efficacy of Artesunate- Amodiaquine combination, show adequate clinical response of 97%.

IPT is preferably provided as part of a comprehensive antenatal package with other products like haematinics and anthelmintics. The drug will also be administered under the supervision of a qualified health worker - \"Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)\". Every pregnant woman should also have access to insecticide treated nets (ITNs), which should be used throughout the pregnancy as an additional method of malaria prevention. 4.2 Drug Of Choice for Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (Sulphadoxine 500mg + Pyrimethamine 25mg) shall be reserved for Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) given under DOT.

A lot of public and private sector investments in equipment and infrastructure have already gone into the production and distribution of Artesunate-Amodiaquine combination therapy. The introduction of the more expensive Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) has further cost implications. To reduce the increased cost burden of ACTs on the most vulnerable populations and ensure their availability and affordability to the population, the recommended ACTs have been incorporated into the National Health Insurance Medicines List . Government also has the task of ensuring access to medicines and product safety to forestall the implementation challenges. It is critical that all anti- malarials deployed are of good quality, safe and efficacious. To this end, the pharmaceutical inspection programmes of the national drug regulatory authority have been intensified and national drug quality control"}

A&E Services MoH Accident and Emergency Services Policy and Guidelines 18 Ministry of Health A&E Services, October, 2011 The Triage Scale (TS) is designed for use in hospital-based emergency services throughout Ghana. It is a scale for rating clinical urgency. Although primarily a clinical tool for ensuring that patients are seen in a timely manner, commensurate with their clinical urgency, the TS is also a useful casemix measure. The scale directly relates triage code/colour with a range of outcome measures (inpatient length of stay, ICU admission, mortality rate) and resource consumption (staff time, cost). It provides an opportunity for analysis of a number of performance indicators in the A & E (casemix, operational efficiency, utilisation review, outcome effectiveness and cost). It is critical to have a standard set of data across the country. The TS is a clinical tool that enable use collect the minimum data set across all facilities. This will allow for comparison of performance within and between hospitals. It will also allow for the merging of the individual data set to form a national database to facilitate analysis for decision-making. . What is Hospital Emergency Triage? A method of ranking sick or injured people according to the severity of their sickness or injury in order to ensure that medical and nursing staff and facilities are used most efficiently; assessment of injury intensity and the immediacy or urgency for medical attention Benefits of Triage: 1. To expedite the delivery of time-critical treatment for patients with life-threatening conditions 2. To ensure that all people requiring emergency care are appropriately categorized according to their clinical condition 3. To improve patient flow 4. To improve patient satisfaction 5. To decrease the patient\u2019s overall length of stay 6. To facilitate streaming of less urgent patients 7. To be user-friendly for"}

The triage assessment and TS code/colour allocated must be recorded. The triage nurse should ensure continuous reassessment of patients who remain waiting, and, if the clinical features change, re-triage the patient accordingly. The triage nurse may also initiate appropriate investigations or initial management according to organisational guidelines. The triage nurse applies an TS category in response to the question: \u201cThis patient should wait for medical assessment and treatment no longer than\u2026.\u201d Environmental and Equipment Requirements The triage area must be immediately accessible and clearly sign-posted. Its size and design must allow for patient examination, privacy and visual access to the entrance and waiting areas, as well as for staff security. A&E Services MoH Accident and Emergency Services Policy and Guidelines 19 Ministry of Health A&E Services, October, 2011 The area should be equipped with emergency equipment, facilities for standard precautions (hand hygiene facilities, gloves), security measures (duress alarms or ready access to security assistance), adequate communications devices (telephone and/or intercom etc) and facilities for recording triage information. The Triage Tool Three versions of the TS There are three versions of the TS, depending on whether the patient is an adult or not. Adults have their own version. However, because children have different values of heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. There are two paediatric versions: one for infants (50cm to 95cm \u2013 one week to almost 3 years), and one for children (96cm to 150cm \u2013 3 years to around 12 years).

The discriminator list follows after the TEWS. The provider needs to calculate the TEWS before moving on to the discriminator list. 1. Triage Early Warning Score (TEWS) In order to generate a total score, the provider has to observe the basic vital signs of the patient. Each vital sign monitors a different physiological system: \u2022 Blood pressure and Heart rate monitor the cardiovascular system (heart and blood flow). You as the provider are interested in the systolic value only. That is the top value of the blood pressure (BP=120/80, systolic BP or SBP=120) \u2022 Respiratory rate monitors the respiratory system (lungs) \u2022 Temperature monitors thermoregulatory system (infections, hypothermia) \u2022 Alertness, Verbal response, Reaction to pain and Unresponsiveness (AVPU) monitors the central nervous system (brain) \u2022 Mobility monitors the musculoskeletal system (bones and muscles) \u2022 Trauma refers to the presence of ANY injury (bump, bruise, cut etc) By comparing the observed basic vitals of the patient with a parameter on the TEWS calculator (horizontally) a score can be read off (vertically). These scores are added together which gives the provider a total TEWS. 2. Discriminator List The second part or the discriminator list is the part that generates the actual triage colour (red, orange, yellow, green, blue) which will determine urgency level and essentially also when the patient will be attended to. As with the TEWS, there are separate versions of this for infants, children and adults respectively. A&E Services MoH Accident and Emergency Services Policy and Guidelines 20 Ministry of Health A&E Services, October, 2011 The TEWS will only identify and classify a patient into an appropriate triage code if the physiology of the patient is altered from normal. The TEWS will be effective for most of the cases"}

There are however some discriminators that require special attention. It has been found that physiology alone does not pick up and classify patients with these discriminators safely and effectively.

They are reclassified after the TEWS has been calculated The Stepwise Approach The Stepwise flowchart poster shows how simple it is to calculate the triage code for a patient by simply following the stepwise approach. This approach allows the triage provider to code patients both effectively and safely in the minimum time period. Triage providers should always use this approach unless directed otherwise by a senior health care professional. Triage Interventions and Management Aids Management of the patient starts when the triage provider\u2019s analysis starts. It is therefore critical that this management continues after the triage process has been completed.

The revision was based on the second Programme of Work of the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organisation\u2019s guidelines for drug policy development and implementation and recent developments in World trade, including Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and its Public Health Safeguards. These reflect concerns raised regarding access to medicines for managing existing and emerging diseases of public health importance such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis malaria and buruli ulcer. The policy document is to guide the pharmaceutical sector in Ghana. The various elements examined under the policy include, legislation and regulatory control, drug registration, selection of essential drugs, local manufacture, herbal medicines, drug procurement and supply management, quality assurance, co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation. In highlighting these areas, due cognizance has been given to available resources, potential of drugs in disease management and the socio-economic environment. The policy has also been formulated with an inherent flexibility to accommodate future developments and"}

Drugs (including vaccines) cut across all major areas of health care delivery. The absence or inadequate supply of drugs has always led to a loss of confidence in the health care system. Drugs are useful in promoting health, preventing and managing diseases but can be harmful when used inappropriately. The inappropriate use of drugs has medical and social implications and may exert undue financial burden on the health care system as well as on patients. For example, drugs are estimated to constitute 60 - 80 % of the cost of health care in Ghana. It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that certain functions in the pharmaceutical sector are clearly defined and implemented. A national drug policy forms the basis of government\u2019s responsibility to ensure access of its citizens to good quality drugs at affordable prices, enacting drug regulations, developing"}

The government\u2019s responsibility to meeting the aims of the National Drug Policy cannot be delegated. It can be implemented by very different mechanisms with various forms of participation by the main stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector. The existence of this document is a sign of government's awareness of the problems facing Ghana in the pharmaceutical sector. It forms a basis for planning and implementation, monitoring and evaluation of interventions in the pharmaceutical sector. In its efforts to achieve this, the Ministry of Health and other related ministries and agencies have faced a number of problems including the following: \u2022 An under-developed machinery to ensure enforcement of existing laws and regulations resulting in poor compliance; \u2022 Lack of qualified and experienced management and technical personnel, inadequate drug supply management procedures, unsuitable and insufficient distribution and storage facilities, often resulting in increased procurement costs and losses; \u2022 Lack of systematic and continuing education coupled with inadequate reference and learning materials for various sectors of the healthcare delivery system have 2 contributed to poor patient care practices (including inappropriate use of drugs) and efficiency; \u2022 The increasing cost of drugs and medical supplies with the expanding provision of health services and its effect on the national health budget; and \u2022 The dramatic increase in the number of drug outlets in both the public and private sectors. In addition the number of drugs currently registered by the drug regulatory agency stands at 680 generics and 2100 specialities. The Ministry of Health has taken a number of steps directed at addressing some of the problems. These include: \u2022 The promulgation of the Food and Drugs Law 1992 (PNDCL 305B) and the Pharmacy Act, 1994 (Act 489), which have provided the legal framework for the control of"}

Recent developments in the global pharmaceutical arena have implication for the national drug policy. These developments include the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights/World Trade Organisation (TRIPS/WTO) agreement and how it affects generic drugs, drugs for emerging diseases and pharmaceutical trade. The HIV/AIDS pandemic and the inability of poor countries to pay the high prices of the multi-national pharmaceutical companies have also received great attention. At the national level there is an emerging shift in health financing strategies from out of pocket expenditure by patients to health insurance schemes. The introduction of VAT and the implementation of the government\u2019s exemption policy will impact on the present drug policy. While these debates are ongoing and procedures/mechanisms are being developed, a document of this nature must capture these trends and provide for them. This constitutes the basis for the revision of the National Drug Policy. 3 GOAL The overall goal of the policy is to improve and sustain the health of the population of Ghana by ensuring the rational use and access to safe, effective, good quality and affordable pharmaceutical products OBJECTIVES The objectives of the policy are to: 9 Promote the rational use of drugs by prescribers, dispensers and consumers; 9 Strengthen quality assurance by ensuring that only safe and effective drugs are sold or supplied to consumers"}

However, making drugs available to people and ensuring their safe, effective and rational use is often not without its accompanying problems. The emergence of National Drug Policies (NDPs) in the second half of the 20th century was a positive concept for achieving optimal availability and use of drugs. The policies have often been initiated with the support of the World Health Organisation as well as other bilateral and multilateral agencies and non-governmental organisations. NDPs have provided a framework for coordinating activities in the sector involving public, private, NGOs, donors and other stakeholders by specifying the goals, their relative importance and the main strategies for attaining them. Following years of long planning and discussions among various stakeholders, Ghana launched its first national drugs policy in 1999 to serve as a reference guide for national pharmaceutical development. The specified goal of the policy was \u201cto make essential drugs available and accessible to the population; to ensure the safety, efficacy and the quality of drugs and their rational use by prescribers, dispensers and consumers\u201d. The components of the policy included drug selection and registration, drug procurement, local manufacture and drug storage and distribution. It also dealt with issues involving rational drug use, drug advertising and human resource development as well as drug financing, quality assurance, and traditional herbal"}
{"source_file": "Ghana-National-Drug-Policy-2nd-edition.pdf", "chunk_id": "Ghana-National-Drug-Policy-2nd-edition_8", "text": "medicines among others. The policy specified a number of strategies for achieving the above goal. For example it sought to improve the supply of essential drugs in the public sector by increasing the drug budget and specifying the introduction of cost sharing and allocation of more resources to underserved populations and areas. It also spelt out procedures for drug procurement, supply and local manufacture. The policy was also formulated with an inherent flexibility to accommodate future developments and changes with the overall vision of attaining health for the entire population of Ghana. The following constitute a brief appraisal of some of the key components. Drug legislation and regulation The enactment of appropriate legislation and introduction of regulations to provide legal basis is necessary to make NDP enforceable. Such legislation specify the 5 various actors and their responsibilities in the system regarding those who can produce, or import pharmaceuticals as well as the range of prescribers, sellers and the type of products they can sell. It also specifies various institutions for monitoring and enforcing regulations and ensures product quality, safety and efficacy. The legislative models and structures in Ghana however, indicate that: - Laws and regulations have been difficult to enforce due to lack of capacity and limited logistics. - Penalties and sanctions have not been used. There is therefore a need to review existing regulations and amend operations to make them adaptive to local realities and make them enforceable. The situation calls for a well organized and trained inspection unit and a system of quality control. Drug selection, registration and supply The selection of essential drugs that are safe, of high quality and effective and their proper registration are important components of NDPs. Since the essential drugs concept was introduced by the WHO in the late seventies, many countries have"}

The Ministry of Health of Ghana published its list of essential drugs with therapeutic guidelines in 1988. Since then the document has undergone reviews in response to new knowledge on drugs and diseases as well as changes in the epidemiology of disease in Ghana. The fourth editions of the Essential Drugs List (EDL) and the Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) were published in 2000. The target of bi-annual review of the Standard Treatment Guidelines and the Essential Drugs List has not been achievable. However, a review of the procedure for selecting drugs for the Essential Drugs List was put into effect in the year 2000. This resulted in the selection of drugs based on evidence that they are the most appropriate for treating health problems in the country. While the application of the list in the public sector is commonly adhered to, in the private sector any drug registered by the Food and Drugs Board may be used. Drug registration and licensing are therefore important tools of drug selection in Ghana\u2019s NDP. Apart from quality, safety and efficacy, other important regulatory aspects include drug advertisements, standards of practice for drug outlets, post- marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The Ghana National Drugs Programme has funded activities in both FDB and the Pharmacy Council to improve on these factors including the establishment of a National Pharmacovigilance Centre. The preponderance of imported pharmaceutical products has on occasion resulted in the procurement of substandard products. A well-established and functioning 6 laboratory for the FDB or identification of local laboratories to carry out quality assessment of products is needed. Procurement Ghana has a state system for procurement in the public sector. A functioning Procurement Unit is now established for the health sector resulting in improvement"}

In the procurement of pharmaceuticals, the use of international competitive bidding has resulted in good prices for the sector. Manuals on procurement procedures have been developed and nationwide training on their use conducted. Systems for quantification of drugs and inventory management however need improvement. There is also the need to upgrade the skills of trained staff in implementing standard operating procedures prepared for the management of medicines, supplies and equipment. Local Manufacture The growth and capacity of local pharmaceutical production is still marginal. Local manufacture has also been weighed down by the free market policy of the government and lack of tax exemptions for raw materials thereby adversely affecting production and competition. Drug Distribution Drug distribution has improved essentially as a result of decentralisation of the health service and the revolving drug fund concept. The role of the Central Medical Stores in drug supply is yet to be fully clarified. A comprehensive distribution arrangement to move pharmaceutical products and other medical supplies from the medical stores to the service points is a major bottle neck to access to these items. Rational drug use The rational use of drugs is one of the major objectives of every drug policy. In Ghana, the recognition of the role of various health professions in achieving this objective has led to the establishment of a clinical pharmacy training programme, workshops for health personnel in various institutions and retraining of chemical sellers. The interventions introduced to improve the use of medicines have resulted in some gains including a reduction in the average number of drugs prescribed per out- patient encounter from 4.6 to 3.7. In addition, the proportion of out-patients receiving antibiotics and injections have reduced from 54% and 38% to 42% and 33% 7 respectively. However, as in most developing countries, inadequate"}

In general, while several activities have been carried out to promote rational prescribing and dispensing in the public sector, a lot remains to be done in the private sector. An important factor that hinders rational use of drugs is the lack of unbiased objective drug information. Through the Ghana National Drugs Programme an Information Resource Centre has been established to deal with this particular aspect of use of medicines for both health providers and clients. Public education in rational drug use to provide individuals and communities with information and skills on appropriate, safe and judicious use have also lagged behind. Additional focused programmes also need to be carried out in both public and private sectors. Financing drugs The main challenge of drug policy is how to ensure stable and adequate financing. The public health care services in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa was characterised by state finance during the immediate postcolonial period. However, economic difficulties have compelled the introduction of user charges in recent years. The goal of this has been to maximize resources for drugs by ensuring continuous supply at low prices in order to improve economic accessibility. In Ghana mechanisms to increase economic accessibility has led to plans to implement health insurance and encourage generic prescribing. The drug policy has to date been unable to address abuses and problems associated with government suggested exemptions for specified groups of people who are considered incapable of paying for drugs at public health institutions. Drug Pricing Ghana has a long tradition of innovation and reform in the organization and delivery of its health services. The planned introduction of the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) follows earlier efforts to"}

The NHIF will replace the cash-and-carry system for financing health services medicines while maintaining local facility autonomy in managing their revolving drug funds (RDF). This autonomy increased local management\u2019s discretion over drug procurement and pricing, within clear guidelines. These guidelines state 8 that public facilities should buy first from the public sector and should mark up at a fixed 10 percent margin for Regional Medical Stores (RMS) and for Service Delivery points (SDPs). The MOH/Ghana Health Service (GHS) has been receiving reports of non-compliance with these guidelines within the public sector. RMS and SDPs have reportedly increased their procurement from the private sector while the considerable variation in drug prices indicate margins in excess of 10 percent. More therefore needs to be done to regulate retail margin. Traditional Medicines The role of traditional medicines and traditional medicine practitioners in the health care delivery system is recognised and the Traditional and Alternate Medicines Directorate of the Ghana Health Service has been established. Efforts are directed at bringing all traditional medicine practitioners under one national organisation; preparing guidelines for standards of practice and ethics, and a training manual for the profession. The Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine and other research institutions like the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research continue to evaluate herbal medicines. The Food and Drugs Board has instituted a procedure for the registration of herbal products. The Traditional and Alternate Medicines Directorate will have to build the needed capacity to enable it forge links with partners and also exercise its mandate to ensure that traditional medicine products are safe, efficacious and of good quality. Monitoring, evaluation and research The need for routine monitoring of the NDP to evaluate its impact at regular intervals is also essential for the success of NDP."}

Research to improve health services and health care include baseline studies of the pharmaceutical sector covering rational drug use, procurement and financing of drugs and Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs and Practices (KABP) studies on rational use of medicines in Ghana. The latter was geared towards the design of appropriate and effective strategy for meaningful information, education and communication on rational drug use. However, no research on the development of new products has been conducted. 9 This edition of the NDP differs from the earlier one in some significant respects. The current one incorporates an implementation plan to ensure that responsible organisations and individuals appropriately tackle all issues raised in the NDP. This edition also deals with intellectual property rights as contained in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPS). It also covers local production of antiretroviral drugs necessitated by the importance of HIV/AIDS in the disease profile of the country.

For various reasons there is easy access, with or without a prescription, to medicines and traditional medicinal products in Ghana thereby increasing the possibility of misuse and the development of unwanted events related to these products. The rational use of drugs requires that people receive medicines appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their individual requirements for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and the community along with the requisite information. There is therefore the need for the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the medicines and traditional medicinal products"}

The TRIPS agreement introduces global minimum standards for protecting and enforcing nearly all forms of intellectual property rights, including pharmaceutical products and processes. The TRIPS agreement raises concerns about the major impact of this agreement on people\u2019s access to drugs and public health. Governments are required to bring their legislation on intellectual property rights to conform to the TRIPS agreement within a five-year transitional period. 7.2 Objective To ensure that legislation and regulations developed maintain a balance between the minimum standard of intellectual Property Rights protection and the public health good. 7.3 Policy statement 7.3.1 In implementing regulations related to intellectual property rights, Government shall take advantage of all the safeguards within the TRIPS Agreement for the promotion of public health and ensuring access to pharmaceuticals. 7.3.2 Government shall not enact legislation and regulations more stringent than the TRIPS requirement. 7.3.3 The MOH shall actively collaborate with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Attorney General\u2019s Department and other relevant agencies in the area of intellectual property rights in developing consistent legal framework that enhances access to essential drugs. 7.3.4 Parallel importation shall be permitted for pharmaceuticals when the protection of the health of the public is concerned. 7.3.5 The government shall grant compulsory licensing (e.g. local manufacture and generic version of patented products) to promote competition and access to drugs when the health of the public is at stake. 7.3.6 Regarding the exploitation of the rights conferred by patency on pharmaceuticals, the government shall design laws that prescribes a limited period immediately preceding the expiry of"}

Such diseases usually become issues of concern when treatment is very expensive and out of the reach of most of the people, or the treatment or control is simply difficult or not available at all. 8.2 Objective To provide needed drugs to adequately treat and control such diseases, and also make other resources available where there are special needs. 8.3 Policy statement 8.3.1 A system shall be put in place to provide needed drugs for new diseases and existing ones posing new challenges. Both the public and private sectors shall be involved. 8.3.2 The Ministry of Health shall collaborate with the relevant international bodies to mobilise resources for these cases, where they cannot be provided from the country. 8.3.3 Where emerging diseases with no previously known treatment have been identified, the Government shall support and fund the research, development and local manufacture of the needed drugs and herbal preparations. 23 9.0 HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FOR DRUG MANAGEMENT 9.1 Preamble Human resource development is paramount and shall be given a major focus in the Health Sector.

This strategy document aligns with the Ghana UHC roadmap 2020-2030 and reflects the broader objectives set out in the Health Sector Medium Term Development Plan 2022 - 2025. It demonstrates the Ministry's commitment to creating a robust healthcare system that guarantees equitable access to quality healthcare services for all citizens. The alignment of these objectives and strategies exemplifies our comprehensive approach to enhancing healthcare delivery in Ghana. The Health Financing Strategy acknowledges Primary Health Care as the foundation of our healthcare system, emphasising its role in preventing diseases, promoting health, and delivering essential services. The objective of the strategy is to among others, strengthen the capacity of our Healthcare facilities, ensuring that they serve as the first point of contact for our citizens, delivering cost-effective and quality care. One of the principles essential to delivering Universal Primary Health Care is the Network of Practice. It is designed to enhance collaboration, coordination, and communication among healthcare providers within the healthcare ecosystem. It adopts an approach of shared knowledge and best practices, ensuring that innovations in healthcare financing are swiftly translated into tangible benefits for the Ghanaian population. The Health Financing Strategy emphasizes improving health financing mechanisms as financial barriers are among the most significant impediments to healthcare access. Therefore, this strategy outlines comprehensive measures to enhance revenue mobilisation, optimise resource allocation, and establish efficient mechanisms for risk sharing and equitable distribution of resources. As we implement this document,"}

Finally, the Ministry of Health appreciates all institutions, partners and stakeholders who contributed in diverse ways to the development of this document. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT xiv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Recognizing the importance of surgical, obstetric, trauma and anaesthesia (SOTA) services as indispensable components of national health systems; and critical to achieving Universal Health Coverage, there have been global calls for countries to develop comprehensive national plans to address quality and access gaps in these services. In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) reported that approximately 5 billion people globally lack access to surgery and several millions experienced catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditure due to out-of-pocket payment for surgical services. The Commission projected that between 2015 and 2030, the global economic loss due to surgical conditions will amount to 20.7 trillion dollars with the brunt of these losses borne by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The LCoGS recommended the recognition of surgery as a critical component of global health and called on countries to develop coordinated plans to improve access and quality of surgery and improve surgical outcomes. Subsequent to this, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed resolution WHA68.15, which also called for strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anaesthesia as a component of Universal Health Coverage. Ghana\u2019s health sector has made remarkable strides in the provision of high quality, accessible, safe and equitable health services for its citizens and all persons living in Ghana. However, issues of lack of access to safe, affordable and timely surgical and anaesthesia care identified by the LCoGS have not been addressed. This underscores the need for a framework that supports scale-up of SOTA access in a coordinated and effective manner. In response to this,"}

This plan is aimed at improving the health outcomes of people living in Ghana by providing safe, high-quality and affordable SOTA care for all. The NSOAP outlines goals, strategic objectives, strategic interventions, activities and indicators relating to the six domains of infrastructure, workforce, service delivery, financing, information management as well as governance and leadership. The plan serves as the blueprint for SOTA services in the country for the next five years (2025-2029). This NSOAP is focused on addressing disparities in access to SOTA care by targeting investments in infrastructure at Primary/District, Secondary/Regional and Tertiary/Teaching level hospitals. These include refurbishing surgical, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY xv obstetric and anaesthesia infrastructure at existing health facilities, expanding the training of SOTA professionals and improving the surgical services across health facilities in the country. The plan has mechanisms for equitable distribution of the needed health professionals and strategies for retaining them particularly in underserved areas. The plan also takes into consideration strategies for leveraging technology to improve service delivery and for engaging communities for targeted outreach programs to improve access to services. Disparities in access to care will be resolved by bringing into focus neglected surgically treatable conditions such as structural birth defects, and gender-based violence cases requiring SOTA care. Quality of surgical care will be promoted and tracked as part of this NSOAP. This NSOAP also gives attention to data management systems and research related to SOTA. It outlines some strategies for mobilizing resources such as government allocation, support from development partners and public-private partnerships. The NSOAP is expected to be coordinated at the national level through a Steering Committee with leadership at the various levels of health care and"}

The plan is to be implemented not as a standalone plan but integrated into National policies as it finds expression in existing policies and strategies of the Ministry of Health including the Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan and the National Health Policy. xvi FOREWORD The first National Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia Plan (NSOAP) for Ghana reflects the nation\u2019s aspiration to address the critical gaps in surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia care and improve the lives of citizens and all persons living in Ghana. This document indicates strategic interventions, concrete targets, clear strategic indicators, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring and evaluation framework to track progress and ensure accountability. The Ministry of Health considers the NSOAP as a crucial document which primarily aims at improving the health outcomes of people, particularly in surgical care, obstetrics, and anaesthesia services. The plan also takes into consideration the importance of addressing the social determinants of health such as poverty, gender inequality and lack of education which can have a critical impact on health outcomes. In this regard, access to safe, quality, and affordable surgical services is part of the tenets in developing the NSOAP for Ghana and this is considered a fundamental right of all people living in Ghana. This comprehensive plan represents the massive efforts of various stakeholders including various health care professionals in the sixteen (16) regions of Ghana, policy makers and selected representatives from agencies"}

Each year, an estimated 77.2 million disability-adjusted life- years (DALYs) could be averted by scaling up basic, live saving surgical care in LMICs1. The need for SOTA care in LMICs is projected to continue rising considerably into the future as diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, congenital anomalies as well as injuries from road traffic accidents increase2. These conditions, if not tackled effectively, will deprive LMICs of progress towards attainment of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. Access to affordable, timely and safe SOTA care therefore needs to be prioritised for countries in these regions. Promoting SOTA care as a global, continental or national priority will require significant buy-in from a cross section of political and social leaders. Gaining buy-in involves building a compelling, data- driven case about how SOTA care contributes to the health and economic well-being of a country. The importance of surgical services even within the Primary Health Care (PHC) system has been underscored by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS)3 and the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution WHA68.15; \"Strengthening emergency and essential surgical care and anaesthesia as a component of UHC\"4 and the Integrated Emergency Critical and Operative (ECO) care resolution (WHA 76.2)5. The LCoGS in their publication in 2015 showed that billions of people worldwide lacked access to surgery with further millions experiencing catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditure due to out-of-pocket payment for surgical services. The Commission also estimated that between 2015 and 2030, surgical conditions will account for a cumulative loss of 20.7 trillion dollars to the global economy.

The Commission highlighted the indispensability of surgery as part of CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 2 health care and recommended actions to embed surgery as an important component of the global health agenda with countries developing scalable solutions for quality SOTA care3. The availability, quality, and affordability of surgery must be prioritized for improvement by governments making major, targeted efforts to address the current surgical care crisis. These efforts must be led by Ministries of Health in the respective countries. Strategic planning that considers all six surgical system areas (infrastructure including medical products and technology, workforce, service delivery, information management, financing and governance and leadership) has been recommended for developing blueprints for improving and expanding access to SOTA care on a national scale. This health systems approach spearheaded by national governments, shifts the direction of surgical care development away from discrete vertical projects. The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ghana, recognizes emergency and essential SOTA care as critical components of its health system and crucial to attainment of UHC. In view of that and in alignment with global calls, the Ministry, working with its agencies and in collaboration with other sectors, civil society organizations, development partners and the private sector, has developed the National Surgical Obstetric and Anaesthesia Plan (NSOAP) for Ghana. This is to serve as a policy instrument through which equitable access to SOTA care can be expanded in the country using coordinated health policy efforts. 1.2 Country Background 1.2.1 Demographic and Socioeconomic Landscape Administratively, Ghana Is divided into 16 regions and 261 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies.

Notably, approximately 35.3% of the population comprises individuals under the age of 15, underscoring the significant presence of children in the demographic landscape. Ghana\u2019s urban population increased from 50.9% in 2010 to 56.7% in 20216. The urban population, totalling 17,472,530 people, highlights the substantial urbanization within Ghana6. Ghana\u2019s population age structure is transitioning from one dominated by children to a population dominated by the youth. The working age bracket of 15-64 years constitute 60.4% of the total population6. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line dropped by more than half from 52.7% in 1991 to 24.2% in 2013, thereby achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1 target7. However, annual rate 3 of reduction in poverty has since slowed down significantly. With approximately a quarter (23.4%) of the Ghanaian population earning wages below the national poverty line and current GDP estimated as US$2,238.2 per capita7,8, Ghana faces economic challenges, which are reflected in the country\u2019s poor state of health. Also, gains made in health and economic indicators are skewed towards urban settings showing inequity in health and development outcomes. These indicators collectively illuminate Ghana's demographic composition, economic status, and prevalent socioeconomic obstacles, providing crucial insights for policy makers tasked with addressing issues ranging from poverty alleviation to healthcare and urban development initiatives. Additionally, these statistics highlight the need for strategic planning in SOTA to optimize the scarce available resources. The NSOAP is therefore timely in this regard. Table 1.

Health indicators including Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and mortality rate in children under-5 years old provide insights into the health status of women and children in Ghana and carry significant implications for NSOAP. Ghana's MMR stands at 310 deaths per 100,000 live births, indicating challenges in accessing quality maternal healthcare services9. Other key indicators linked to SOTA care including infant and under-5 mortality rates have equally improved over the years. Infant Mortality Rate has decreased from 64 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2003 to 28 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022, and under-5 mortality rate has decreased from 111 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2003 to 40 deaths per 1,000 live births in 202210 (Table 2). 4 Table 2.

Hospitals postponed most elective surgical procedures for weeks and even months. In Ghana, an estimated 14,549 surgeries, including 1,405 cancer procedures, were cancelled during the initial phase of the COVID- 19 pandemic11. Hospitals were expected to perform twenty percent more surgical procedures each week than they did before the epidemic to clear this backlog."}

However, every extra week of disruption, resulted in the cancellation of additional procedures, which greatly increased the amount of time needed to clear the backlog. This resulted in worsening the already existing surgical access gap. At present, surgical teams continue to work hard to clear the backlog of surgical cases worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. 1.2.4 Structure of Ghana's Health System Ghana\u2019s health sector is under the leadership of the Minister of Health. The MoH is responsible for formulating health policies and strategies for the entire country. It implements its mandate primarily through its Agencies which perform health care service delivery, health financing, regulatory as well as research and training functions. The Ghana Health Service (GHS), the largest public health delivery service agency of the MoH was established under the Ghana Health Services and Teaching Hospitals Act 525 of 1996 to implement National policies on health delivery at the Regional, District Sub-district and Community levels. Teaching hospitals, also established under Act 525 are autonomous Agencies under the MoH responsible for providing advanced level care. These hospitals have their own Board of Directors. Ghana has a National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) provided by the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), another agency of the MoH. There are other private health insurance policies provided by other companies. These insurance schemes provide a cover for health services for its insured members, thus reducing out-of-pocket expenditure on health. Health insurance coverage for the population is 68.8% with higher coverage for females (72.6%) than males (64.5%)6. 5 Health care delivery is organized at three levels: Primary (District), Secondary (Regional) and Tertiary (Teaching hospital) levels (Figure 1).

These challenges underscore the need for a framework that support scale-up of SOTA care and access to these services in a coordinated and effective manner. In response to this and to drive Ghana closer to achieving global health priorities such as the Sustainable Development Goals and UHC, there is a need to develop a well-informed, costed and realistic NSOAP in line with Ghana\u2019s overall National Health Policy, the GHS Strategic Plan, the Public Health Workforce Strategic Plan and the Human Resources for Health strategies of the country. 8 This NSOAP will be the blueprint to guide the achievement of strategic priorities across the six surgical system areas (infrastructure including medical products, and technology, workforce, service delivery, information management, finance and leadership and governance. It will serve as policy instrument for improving the health outcomes of people living in Ghana, particularly in SOTA care by providing safe, high-quality and affordable surgical services.

This requires services that are linked to communities through primary care including effective communication, transportation, referral and counter-referral mechanisms. The ECO care resolution represents a powerful call for action to strengthen health systems, especially at the primary health care level to deliver high-quality emergency, critical and operative care35. B. Lancet Commission on Global Surgery\u2019s Recommendations The need for NSOAPs was brought to the fore by work done by LCoGS. In 2015, the Commission revealed that close to 5 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, timely and affordable surgery when needed and that an additional 143 million surgical procedures are needed in LMICs each year to save lives and prevent disability. The Commission further proposed recommendations to countries including development of a National Plan to support scale-up of access to surgical care in a coordinated manner3. Indicators previously used to monitor surgical conditions and delivery of SOTA care were not uniform across countries. Cognizance of the challenges of lack of standardized metrics 9 for global surgery surveillance and its implication on comparability and utilization of the limited available data, six core indicators were recommended to countries to monitor their progress towards attainment of minimum benchmarks for equitable, affordable and high-quality SOTA care. All six indicators are included in the World Health Organization (WHO) Core Health indicators and four of them included in the World Bank Development indicators. C. Other Global Standards and Guidelines This NSOAP also draws on global standards and guidelines such as the WHO Global Guidelines for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infections; WHO Guidelines for Safe Surgery; WHO Safe Surgical Checklist; United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC) Updated Guideline for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection; as well as the WHO Generic Essential Emergency Equipment Checklist. 1.6.2 Continental Strategies and"}

Africa Health Strategy 2016-2030 The Africa Health Strategy (AHS) 2016-2030 by the African Union focuses on strengthening health systems and increasing investments in healthcare to reduce morbidity and mortality and address the social determinants of health. The AHS prioritizes training more healthcare professionals including SOTA professionals. It also has investment in health care infrastructure as one of its priorities. It prioritizes improving access to surgical equipment, operating theatres and essential medications as well as equitable access to SOTA care. It recognizes the use of data for tracking progress and decision-making14. This NSOAP aligns perfectly with the priorities of the AHS 2016- 2030. This NSOAP seeks to invest in human resources for health by training and retaining SOTA professionals in the country; contribute to attainment of UHC by ensuring that SOTA services are accessible to all; and improve the overall health system through strengthening infrastructure, health information systems and supply chain management for SOTA care. 1.6.3 National policies and priorities A. National Health Policy and other Policy Instruments This NSOAP aims to contribute significantly to the achievement of healthy lives for all people living in Ghana through an enabling policy framework that recognizes, empowers and brings together, in a coordinated manner, all stakeholders to promote, restore and maintain good health for all people living in Ghana.

Primary Health Care Strategy In Ghana, PHC means essential health care made universally accessible to individuals and acceptable to them, through their full participation and at a cost the individual, community and country can afford. PHC addresses the broader determinants of health and focuses on the comprehensive and interrelated aspects of physical, mental, and social well-being. The GHS has adopted a model for the implementation of PHC known as the CHPS initiative. The CHPS initiative characterizes the key strategy for delivering healthcare at the doorstep of individuals which is beneficial to communities located over 5 kilometres from health facilities. This includes health education and promotion strategies which could facilitate the prevention of conditions amenable to surgical care. In Ghana, geographic access is a major barrier to health care. About 70% of the population resides in communities that are over 5 kilometres from the nearest health facility. Childhood mortality in such communities is 40 per cent higher than in communities located within 5 kilometres of health facilities. The NSOAP addresses access to quality surgical, obstetric, trauma and anaesthesia care even at the PHC level. 11 C. Institutional Care Department and Surgery The Institutional Care Division (ICD) is mandated by the GHS to provide supervision for all clinical care activities in Ghana. The Division"}

The activities of the Division involve formulating and developing clinical care policies, and standard guidelines for clinical practice, supporting its implementation, monitoring clinical care services to ensure compliance with the standards and the provision of effective, efficient, and safe service delivery in all GHS facilities and agencies to which services may be contracted. The ICD spearheads the structured Obstetric Triage Implementation Package (OTIP) project. The OTIP is a formalized and systematic way of recognizing the seriously ill obstetric patient and prioritizing their care. In terms of governance, the ICD is the main department which would oversee SOTA care in Ghana. 1.7 NSOAP Development Process The NSOAP was developed under the leadership of the Minister of Health working through the NSOAP Technical Working Group (TWG) which was inaugurated in March 2020. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) National Surgical, Obstetric and Anaesthesia Planning Manual (Edition 2020) was used as guide in development of the NSOAP17. This NSOAP was developed in alignment with global, continental and national initiatives. These include the LCoGS recommendation and WHA resolution at the global level3,4, the Africa Health Strategy 2016-2030 launched by the African Union at the continental level14 and the UHC Roadmap15, National Health Policy16, and its Priority Operational Plan at the national level. The NSOAP aims to support the National Health Policy's objective to \"improve surgical services through providing adequate resources.\" and encourage the usage and accessibility of reasonably priced, high-quality assistive technologies and gadgets. 12 Figure 2.

The scope, action plan, and deadlines for the development of the NSOAP were decided upon by the MoH in coordination with other stakeholders. The stakeholders made up of concerned professional societies, health financing regulators, academia, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), policy experts, health care workers and MoH leadership convened for the first time to decide on the best course of action for completing the objective. 1.7.3 Establishment of the Technical Working Group In order to support the MoH in defining priorities in the delivery of SOTA care, as well as to supervise the development of the NSOAP, a TWG was established during the stakeholder conference. The MoH, Academia, Health Professional Associations, Health Financing Regulators, Service Providers, Anaesthesia Specialists, Public Health Experts, Surgical Experts, Policy Experts, Specialists in 13 Research, Statistics and Information Management, as well as Human Resources Experts make up the TWG.

A narrative review of the state of surgery, obstetrics and anaesthesia care in Ghana provided a rich source of information to complement the situation analysis18. The Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the SOTA system was carried out. The situation analysis provided a base information on the existing situation of SOTA care, an evidence-based quantification of the actual SOTA needs and provides a foundation for priority setting. 1.7.7 Prioritization and Strategic Priority Development The prioritization was done through a series of consultative stakeholder engagements. The TWG had a series of meetings and subject matter experts were engaged to identify the priority areas. A narrative review done on state of surgery, obstetrics, trauma and anaesthesia care in Ghana was reviewed and used to complement information from the baseline assessment done by the TWG and stakeholder engagement efforts.

Further engagement with stakeholders was carried out to have a better understanding of the identified gaps and plans for addressing the gaps. The engagement also sought to ensure that stakeholders views were reflected in the NSOAP. The NSOAP was reviewed further by the members of TWG and officials of the MoH PPME Division. 1.7.9 Costing and Budgeting The costing of the NSOAP was done based on the planned activities, targets and assumptions on the needs and cost of products and services. The costing was done for each domain of the NSOAP. The 15 total cost of implementing of the NSOAP was derived by summing up the cost for each of the six domains taking into consideration an. inflation factor based on the nature of the activity. 1.7.10 Stakeholder Validation Workshops A multi-stakeholder workshop was held to validate the NSOAP. The document was reviewed by stakeholders to ensure data integrity and accuracy of information. The NSOAP was updated based on comments from the validation workshop and the final document submitted. 1.8 Guiding Principles The NSOAP will be implemented under the following guiding principles: \uf0a7 Safety: To guarantee that patients are shielded from preventable difficulties throughout SOTA procedures in order to maximize positive results \uf0a7 Cost-effective: Provide a financially optimal solution-one that gives"}

The vision of the plan is to ensure that all people in Ghana have timely access to high quality health services irrespective of ability to pay at the point of use.\u201d This includes having timely access to SOTA services. Over the years the country has undergone a series of health system reforms to improve its coverage and efficiency. This includes, enhancing services at the community, increasing ambulance services, instituting the national health insurance scheme among others. The guiding principles for attaining UHC hinged on prioritizing at-risk groups or vulnerable populations such as children, adolescents, aged and those with physical disabilities. Among these groups one of the major barriers to accessing health care is not only distance to health facilities but also financial bottlenecks which the roadmap to UHC seeks to eliminate. Some key interventions highlighted under the UHC are providing essential services"}

This strategy aligns with the need to have NSOAP for Ghana to comprehensively strategize and contribute to the goal of UHC and mandate of the MoH. To be able to develop a well thought through plan, we first established the baseline landscape of SOTA services in Ghana across all levels of the health services to inform strategic interventions. It is generally known that these health services are quite deficient at the lower levels of the health system, as such decentralising these assessments will provide a better picture of the gains and gaps that need to be addressed. The situation analysis followed four main stages (Figure 3) We started by defining what information was needed, reviewed what information already exists, gathered new information, and conducted a SWOT analysis. CHAPTER 2: SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS 18 Adapted from Sonderman et al, 2019 43: Figure 3. Phases of Situation Analysis Situation analysis findings are presented according to the six domains of the NSOAP. 2.1 Infrastructure Adequate infrastructure including physical buildings, equipment and logistics is essential to providing quality SOTA services. Water, electricity and oxygen are fundamental necessities for delivering high-quality SOTA care. The majority 34 (61.8%) of healthcare facilities surveyed in the baseline assessment reported having access to running water at all times. However, it is concerning that one (1.8%) of facilities reported never having access to running water. Reliable access to running water was reported by the majority 4 (80.0%) of Tertiary hospitals and 9 (81.8%) of Secondary/Regional level hospitals and 34 (87.2%) of Primary/District level hospitals (Table 4). Health centres or clinics reported having running water only sometimes. The lack of access to consistent running water hinders the ability to implement effective infection prevention and control measures. This negatively affects"}

However, disparities existed in the reliability of this access, with 21 (38.2%) of facilities reporting almost always having electricity, while one (1.8%) and 8 (14.5%) reported having electricity only sometimes or often, respectively (Table 4). Inconsistencies in electricity supply could significantly impact the operation of critical medical equipment, storage of temperature-sensitive medications, and overall patient care quality. To address this, the NSOAP has prioritized improving the reliability of electricity access in 20 healthcare facilities, by considering investments in backup power systems and infrastructure improvements. Disparities in oxygen availability are evident across healthcare facility levels. Health Centres lack oxygen entirely. Primary hospitals show varying access levels, while Secondary and Tertiary hospitals generally have better access. Tertiary facilities, however, face challenges with consistent access to oxygen. Ensuring reliable oxygen availability, particularly in critical settings, is essential for patient care and medical procedures. The NSOAP will prioritize improving oxygen infrastructure, distribution, and storage, with a focus on tertiary hospitals where inconsistencies were noted. Over 60% of health facilities consistently have access to basic imaging modalities, but health centres and clinics have limited access. District-level facilities generally lack consistent access to imaging and operative room infrastructure, while tertiary facilities have more consistent access. Ensuring equitable access to imaging services across all facility levels is crucial. The plan is focused on enhancing the capacity of health centres and district-level facilities to provide basic imaging services. Investment in infrastructure and"}

Disparities exist in the infrastructure needed to care for acutely ill patients across facility levels. Tertiary facilities have Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and recovery wards, but many Primary Care facilities lack recovery wards. Of the Regional hospitals and Teaching hospitals in the country, 43% of them have ICUs44. Some tertiary facilities also lack consistently functional equipment. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach. Planning is focused on expanding the availability of recovery wards and ICUs, ensuring consistent functionality of equipment, and potentially developing strategies for sharing resources or facilitating referrals from primary to tertiary facilities. 2.2 Workforce The WHO and the LCoGS recommend a minimum of 20 SOTA physician per 100,000 population. With an estimated population of 30.8 million, Ghana requires a minimum of 6,160 SOTA physicians. However, there were approximately 1,920 SOTA physicians in the country29 translating to 6 SOTA physicians per 100000. Adequate SOTA physicians are effective if they are well distributed within the country to provide access to SOTA care. In addition to SOTA physicians, there are other healthcare workers who are critical in providing SOTA care. These include Generalist Medical Practitioners Nurses and Midwives, Pharmacists, 21 Biomedical Scientists among other who provide SOTA care. As of December 2023, Ghana\u2019s medical workforce density (medical and dental including specialities) in the public sector was 5,053 doctors. This number is unevenly distributed across the 16 regions of the country with majority 2890 (57.2%) being taken up by Greater Accra and Ashanti regions. This pattern is similar to what exists in the nursing profession where Ashanti region had the highest number of 16,245 followed by the Greater Accra region with 13,810. The Northeast region had the least representation with 2,139 nurses. Workforce migration, which has been reported to be high among the"}
{"source_file": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2.pdf", "chunk_id": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2_31", "text": "nursing professions, poses a challenge to meeting the growing healthcare needs of the entire population. Pharmacists form a core part of the health service delivery team. Greater Accra region has the highest number of 344 Pharmacists followed by Ashanti region with 247. The Northeast region had the least with only 3 Pharmacists serving the entire population of 658,903. With regards to Biomedical Scientists, the highest representation is 541 in the Greater Accra region, followed by the Ashanti region with 349 Biomedical Scientists. The existing pattern in the distribution of these cadres indicates uneven distribution of healthcare workforce in favour of the major cities. This situation further indicates that the core professionals in the medical team that might be targeted to implement the NSOAP might be limited due to the absence of a clear retention plan for service delivery in deprived areas. 22 Doctor-Patient Ratio Nurse-Patient Ratio Pharmacist-Patient Ratio Biomedical Scientist-Patient Ratio Source: Ministry of Health Payroll, December 2023 Figure 4.Healthcare Professional-Patient Ratio and Distribution in Ghana, 2023 23 Additionally, among anaesthesia providers in the baseline analysis, there is a comparatively high number of Certified Registered Anaesthetists (CRA). The number of anaesthesia providers in the baseline survey indicates an apparent strength in anaesthesia services (Table 5). However, there is a concerning shortage of medical doctors specialized in anaesthesia, who by policy are required to provide supervision for CRAs. This highlights a potential need for targeted workforce development initiatives to address the imbalance. The data also underscores the importance of specialty training programs to ensure a well-rounded workforce, particularly in areas experiencing shortages. Understanding the distribution of professionals can inform resource allocation decisions, facilitating the enhancement of service provision in critical areas such as anaesthesia. Furthermore, the presence of non-physicians in critical SOTA services provides an opportunity to emphasize the significance of"}

Another issue aggravating the challenges in Ghana\u2019s workforce density and distribution is the freeze on recruitment since 2020 among some critical health workforce which has possibly yielded gaps in the skilled mix of the workforce for service delivery in some aspects of the public sector. A strong partnership with the private sector could yield appreciable health outcomes. Ghana\u2019s NSOAP therefore aims at maximizing all available resources towards effective and efficient surgical services in a mutually beneficial way to the populace. Gender equality in SOTA workforce is also critical for diversity and better work environments that improve patient care. This NSOAP will not only focus on the SOTA workforce density and distribution across the country but also, gender equality in the SOTA workforce. 24 Table 5.

Based on this, the density of Anaesthesiologists per 100,000 population is computed to be 0.49 representing a huge gap in the required number of Anaesthesiologists for Ghana\u2019s population. There was a notable disparity in the distribution of anaesthesiologists and SOTA workforce in general 25 across the levels of healthcare facilities with a concentration of SOTA workforce at tertiary/teaching hospitals. Over 90% of Anaesthesiologists were in the teaching hospitals. The gap in the anaesthesia manpower at the District hospitals is being filled by non-physician providers of anaesthesia. 2.2.2 Nursing Ghana currently has 41,805 general nurses and 27,286 midwives serving across the country in the public sector as at December 2023. These include 76 Emergency Nurse Specialists, 6 Peri-Operative Nurse Specialists, 10 Critical Care Nurse Specialists, 30 Palliative Care Nurse Specialists, 45 Oncology Nurse Specialists, 4 Ophthalmic Nurse Specialists and 7 Otorhinolaryngology Nurse Specialists trained by the Ghana College of Nurses and Midwives (GCNM)45. Additionally, there are 828 post-basic Perioperative Nurses, 782 post-basic Critical Care Nurses, and 355 post-basic Emergency Nurses. While the NSOAP focuses attention on these categories of nurses providing specialized care, general nurses and midwives on surgical and maternity wards are also considered to be providing SOTA care. 2.2.3 Surgery Surgeons in Ghana tend to concentrate in the urban areas of the country leaving most District level facilities lacking access to specialist surgical care. Surgical subspecialities such as Paediatric Surgery and Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery are also not well represented across health facilities in the country. As of July 2024, there were 19 Paediatric Surgeons in Ghana of which three are in Regional hospitals, two in District hospitals and two in private hospitals. Paediatric surgical care in underserved areas has been delivered largely through outreach programmes. Paediatric outreach programmes have been"}

This is because, the current rate of graduation of Paediatric Surgeons in Ghana if not increased would be unable to cater for the surgical needs of children in Ghana. 2.2.4 Obstetrics and Gynaecology Obstetrician and Gynaecologists represent another critical cadre of professionals critical to achieving optimum SOTA care. There were approximately 453 Obstetrician and Gynaecologists in the country as of July 2024 with a projected need of 871 in 2030. The distribution of this workforce also appears to be in favour of urban areas and in higher level health facilities. However, there is a relative equity in the distribution as urban areas and secondary and tertiary facilities tend to be densely populated and have comparatively more caseload than lower-level facilities in rural areas. Most SOTA Physician Specialists in Ghana are trained either by the GCPS or the West Africa College of Surgeons. Over half of the graduates work in the nation\u2019s capital, Accra or Kumasi, the next largest city in the country47. 26 2.3 Service Delivery The assessment of the service delivery is focused on the availability and access to Bellwether procedures, surgical volumes and quality of the SOTA care. It includes surgical safety measures such as use of surgical safety checklist and tracking of perioperative mortality. 2.3.1 Two - hour access to health facility In the baseline assessment, the indicator which looked at 2-hour access to health facilities showed that 18.5% (10/54) of the health facilities surveyed reported that all their patients always had 2-hour access to the health facilities for SOTA services. About 7.4% (4/54) of the health facilities reported that between 26-50% of their patients were able to have 2-hour access to these services while none of the health facilities surveyed reported a"}

This data highlights disparities in geographical accessibility to healthcare services, which could significantly impact the planning and distribution of SOTA services. The observed variations in accessibility underscore the need to address disparities in geographical access to healthcare services. Limited access to healthcare facilities within a 2-hour timeframe may deter individuals from seeking timely medical care, particularly in emergencies. This could potentially impact the utilisation of SOTA services, with implications for patient outcomes and overall healthcare delivery. Some of the factors contributing to these disparities include poor road network, transport and unavailability of surgical specialists. Table 6.

From the baseline survey, only 19.6% (11/56) of facilities surveyed could perform all the Bellwether procedures. This figure is similar to 20% for District hospitals and less than 43% for Regional hospitals found in the Ghana Harmonised Health Facility Assessment39. Less than a quarter of health facilities surveyed providing all Bellwether procedures may be indicative of inadequate infrastructure, lack of capacity as well as the inequitable distribution of SOTA professionals. The low proportions of facilities capable of performing a full complement of Bellwether procedures may mean patients may have to be referred to higher centres and this could result in delays, increased cost of care and poor outcomes. Of the Bellwether procedures, the highest median annual surgical volume of 499 was recorded for caesarean section followed by laparotomy and then reduction of open fractures (Table 8). 28 Table 8.

The paucity of data points on surgical systems highlights the weakness in the SOTA space and provides opportunities to establish evidence-based policies for system level improvement. Healthcare delivery in Ghana has been transformed using digital health platforms like the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS 2), eTracker software, and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS). These systems improve the quality of healthcare. By making it easier to efficiently record patients' histories and treatment plans, these technologies help doctors provide more efficient patient care. 2.4.1 Data Collection Systems, Verification and Utilisation On the national health data repository, the DHIMS 2 platform and eTracker, data is collated on various service variables including caesarean sections from different levels of care. The DHIMS 2 is used for gathering data from all public facilities and a good number of private facilities. Very limited information is gathered on various surgical and anaesthesia procedures performed and therefore difficult to track over time. There are data points on surgeries, blood transfusions and some key indicators which are not routinely entered into the system. Although these systems have data validation processes to ensure accuracy, these are weak and often not implemented. The use of data from these systems are only accessible to selected facility-level officers, limiting non-health facility actors from accessing and using data for decision making. Human resource data on SOTA can be found on a separate human resource electronic platform within the GHS facilities but these are not detailed enough to include specialization areas within the SOTA system.

This NSOAP proposes the development of a national database for harmonizing and integrating existing SOTA human resource data. 2.4.2 Electronic Health Records Systems Various health facilities have attempted using electronic medical record systems. However, the MoH has deployed the LHIMS, which is a National Electronic Health Record System, to all Teaching, Regional and District hospitals as well as Polyclinics. The MoH is currently extending this technology to Health centres. 30 The LHIMS which as of June 2024 has registered 19.7 million persons, focuses on patient-level transactional data and supports continuity of care by providing health facilities access to real time patient data. It also provides a dashboard for the MoH to access data and reports. The LHIMS provides opportunity for healthcare workers to quickly enter notes, examine medical histories, and access patient records with ease. In the end, this results in better surgical outcomes by facilitating quicker decision-making and enhanced communication among healthcare professionals. The LHIMS also allow for smooth information sharing between various healthcare facilities, which can improve patient-provider communication. This guarantees continuity of care, particularly for patients requiring specialty surgical procedures or receiving therapy at several locations. 2.4.3 Supply Chain Management Information System In addition to the DHIMS 2 and LHIMS, the MoH has the Ghana Integrated Logistics Management System (GhILMIS) which supports supply chain operations and decision making at all levels.

The NHIS covers over 95% of disease conditions prevalent in the country48. The health insurance coverage in Ghana is 68.8%6 with the NHIS coverage being 55.4%. The NHIS and the private health insurance have contributed to reduction of out-of-pocket expenditure on health. However, a large proportion of insured households still experience catastrophic health expenditure49. There is therefore the need to revise current policies to further protect households from catastrophic expenditure. Adding preventive services to the benefits package may be an important first step. 31 Strengths Weaknesses \uf0a7 Existence of policy guidelines aligned with SOTA care (Medical Oxygen, Equipment and Digital Health Policies) \uf0a7 Availability of basic equipment and medical supplies for surgical care services \uf0a7 Broad access to SOTA services through the construction (Agenda 111 Ghana priority health infrastructure projects) and refurbishment of healthcare facilities \uf0a7 The existence of a general ambulance service system \uf0a7 Availability of infrastructure planners and a Biomedical Engineering Directorate at the National level \uf0a7 Availability of a maintenance plan for procurement and a supply budget line \uf0a7 Well-equipped, accredited specialist training institutions and programs for Surgeons, Anaesthetists and Nurses in SOTA \uf0a7 Formal regulatory bodies to regulate training, professional standards and health facility accreditation \uf0a7 Availability of experienced surgical care teams to build the capacity of the inexperienced trainees \uf0a7 Existence of suitable and diverse professional cadres capable of undertaking work in SOTA disciplines \uf0a7 Implementation of performance appraisal systems to assess"}

It also highlights the prioritization of the strategic interventions for the various domains of the NSOAP. 3.1 Vision and Mission 3.1.1 Vision To provide equitable access to essential surgical, obstetric, trauma and anaesthesia care for all persons living in Ghana 3.1.2 Mission To provide safe, accessible, high-quality and timely comprehensive surgical, obstetric, trauma and anaesthesia care to all people living in Ghana, regardless of their age, location and socioeconomic background and in a manner that mitigates impoverishment. By providing equitable access to high-quality, essential surgical, obstetric, trauma and anaesthesia care for all persons living in Ghana, the NSOAP aims to contribute to the MOH\u2019s vision of a healthy population for national development. 3.2 Prioritization The prioritization of interventions took into consideration the results of the baseline survey, situation analysis and other contextual issues obtained from policy documents, publications and grey literature. Contextual issues taken into consideration include, the country\u2019s demographic characteristics, population growth rate, urbanization, availability and distribution of health workforce and infrastructure development among others. In the light of these, improving"}
{"source_file": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2.pdf", "chunk_id": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2_46", "text": "infrastructure, expanding surgical capacity, training SOTA providers, and ensuring access to essential surgical services in both urban and rural areas to meet the increasing demand were prioritized. In addition, interventions and resources to address the specific healthcare needs of children, including paediatric surgeries and maternal health services as well as research initiatives to improve surgical outcomes and patient safety were highlighted for prioritization. Other issues were related to surgical health promotion, screening for various cancers and funding initial management of persons injured in road traffic accidents. CHAPTER 3: STRATEGIC FOCUS 38 In order to optimize SOTA care, this NSOAP highlights the strengthening of diagnostic functions at the various levels of care. This is expected to enhance timely identification of surgical conditions using imaging diagnostics and other tests as well as identification of underlying medical conditions that may impact SOTA care. These services are also important in guiding surgical decisions and enhancing patient safety. Diagnostic services and professionals that provide these services have been planned for in this NSOAP. 3.2.1 Prevention and Early Detection of Cancers Although not a surgical intervention, screening for some childhood, cervical, breast and gastrointestinal cancers has impact on surgical care. This NSOAP therefore includes screening for childhood cancers as part of the child welfare clinic visits. In addition, screening for breast, cervical, prostate and colon cancers will be intensified for prevention and early detection of cancers. Furthermore, a robust immunization programme against the human papilloma virus (HPV) at the appropriate age will be set up for cervical cancer prevention. These strategies form part of comprehensive surgical health promotion. 3.2.2 Fund for Accident and Trauma Patients Initial management of persons with road traffic injuries requires swift decision-making including a decision to transport to health facilities and perform lifesaving interventions. This initial management interventions require payment. However, the"}
{"source_file": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2.pdf", "chunk_id": "FINAL-NSOAP-for-press-2_47", "text": "situations are such that it is often impossible to demand payment for such activities. Setting up a fund possibly from deductions from vehicle insurance premiums, with appropriate disbursal mechanisms to cover the initial management of persons injured in road crashes will be pursued by this NSOAP. Key crosscutting considerations included in the prioritization comprised issues of ECO care, inclusivity and gender, task sharing and use of artificial intelligence in SOTA care. These issues were considered to potentially impact the NSOAP and its implementation. 3.2.3 Intergrated Emergency Critical and Operative Care The NSOAP emphasizes the ECO care concept being promoted by the WHO to reduce preventable deaths and improve overall patient outcomes across SOTA spectrum of care. This seeks to improve access to high-quality essential ECO care services by everyone through the promotion of a seamless continuum of care for patients requiring SOTA care. The NSOAP recognizes the important role of timely and comprehensive continuum of care in emergencies, critical illnesses and obstetric situations and incorporates a strong focus on integrated ECO care. This involves breaking down silos between emergency care, critical care and surgical services and strengthening SOTA interventions 39 that are needed in operating theatres, Emergency Units and ambulatory facilities including the National Ambulance Service at all levels of care. It also includes strengthening the necessary workforce including the Emergency Medical Technicians and other frontline providers. Additionally, it comprises improving medicines and supplies needed to provide the necessary interventions. The NSOAP focuses on strategies to improve ECO services and enhance emergency care systems that serve as the first point of contact for communities. The NSOAP will therefore serve as a tool for implementing integrated ECO care that is accessible to all persons at all levels of the health care system. 3.2.4 Gender and Inclusivity In the NSOAP prioritization, acknowledgement"}

Disparities in access to care including financial access were considered and included. This was done to develop a plan that is inclusive of the needs of women and children including survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) who may require SOTA interventions. Attention is also focused on children\u2019s surgical needs especially structural birth defects which are considered as part of the neglected surgically treatable conditions of LMICs2. This is particularly important because congenital anomalies have emerged among the leading cause of death in children less than 5 years as childhood deaths from infectious diseases and malnutrition have decreased over the decade. This NSOAP embraces strategies to prioritize gender sensitivity. These include disaggregation of data on SOTA care and service utilization by sex and other sociodemographic factors to identify disparities in access to care. This will be critical in developing tailored services that address specific needs of women, men, children and people with other socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The NSOAP also includes development of protocols for addressing GBV that require SOTA care. It includes efforts to minimize stigma, prevent discrimination and provide a welcoming environment for all patients seeking SOTA care. Disaggregation of data on SOTA health workforce by sex will be done and strategies devised to foster gender equality in SOTA training and empowering women for leadership positions in SOTA care. 3.2.5 Task Sharing Task sharing has been embraced by many LMICs to ensure rational redistribution of tasks among health workforce. As a result of the inadequate highly skilled SOTA workforce, other health workers with shorter duration of training and fewer qualifications have been used to supplement the numbers of SOTA professionals especially in underserved areas. In this NSOAP, these cadre of healthcare professionals will be trained to perform certain"}

In Ghana, Physician Assistants and Nurse Anaesthetists, now called CRAs, have been used to supplement the inadequate numbers of medical doctors and Physician Anaesthetists (Anaesthesiologists) respectively. Strengthening and 40 expanding existing task-sharing arrangements to ensure equitable access to SOTA care has been highly prioritized. This would be done through development of specific guidelines for task sharing, as well as adequate monitoring and evaluation of the practice. There is a limit however to the expertise this arrangement will provide and would not be used as a replacement for the requirement for increasing the needed trained workforce. 3.2.6 Artificial Intelligence With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is the need to develop guidelines for its responsible use in SOTA care. Even though the technology will require substantial investment to implement by health facilities, its advantages such as use in improving decision-making, enhancing the provision of SOTA care, and resource allocation will accelerate its adoption and use by health facilities. AI-powered virtual reality simulations, monitoring systems and surgical robots could be leveraged to address the shortage of SOTA care. Despite the benefits of AI in SOTA care, there are drawbacks such as lack of robust data storage and security that are essential for effective functioning. Another weakness is the potential bias in AI algorithms, which may exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. This NSOAP recognizes the potential shortcomings and takes into consideration development of guidelines which will incorporate responsible use of AI for SOTA care. 3.3 Strategic Priority Objectives The plan seeks to improve SOTA care using strategic objectives categorized under the following domains: infrastructure, workforce, service delivery, information management, financing, and governance and leadership. \uf0a7 Infrastructure Improve infrastructure at all service delivery facilities to meet the minimum requirements for offering essential SOTA services \uf0a7 Workforce Ensure the availability and"}

The concept of integration is a fundamental aspect of NSOAP implementation and will allow for ongoing health systems strengthening across a variety of sectors. While the country\u2019s Health Information Management System (DHIMS 2) provides a suitable platform for integration of NSOAP indicators, the use of other applications for collection and transmission of data should be considered. At the health facility level, the Lightwave Health Information Management System would require some adjustment to accommodate the minimum data required for generating the performance indicators. The MoH and GHS will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluating the NSOAP implementation process. Data for the M&E will be combination of routinely collected health data from LHIMS, DHIMS 2, private health facilities and survey data in some cases. To ensure efficiency and sustainability, M&E activities must be integrated into existing monitoring and supervisory visits and other quality improvement activities. 4.1 Monitoring Approaches The strategies for monitoring will include utilization of existing platforms: \uf0a7 Monthly morbidity and mortality meetings \uf0a7 Quarterly review meetings at the District level \uf0a7 Half-year and annual reviews at the Regional and National levels \uf0a7 Monthly supportive supervision by District to Sub-district levels \uf0a7 Quarterly supportive supervision by Region to District levels \uf0a7 Biannual supportive"}

A mid-term evaluation of the NSOAP will be conducted to course correct. Data from the evaluation will be used to inform the needed adjustments in the plan\u2019s targets and implementation approach. At the end of the five years of implementation, an end-term evaluation of the plan will be done to determine the performance, challenges and lessons learnt.

These indicators monitor realization of universal access to safe, affordable SOTA care when needed. The NSOAP will prioritize the LCoGS six core indicators to enable assessment of the current state of surgical care in the country and to allow for comparison against international targets. In addition to the global level indicators, National level indicators will be collected. These indicators, their activities and strategic interventions are organized based on the six domains of the NSOAP: Infrastructure, Workforce, Service Delivery, Information Management, Financing and Governance and Leadership. 4.4.1 Domain 1: Infrastructure This domain is concentrated on expanding and improving infrastructure for SOTA care at health facilities. It takes into consideration maintenance of the infrastructure and building capacity of healthcare workforce to use these equipment and supplies. The strategic interventions under this domain are: \uf0a7 Expanding access to well-equipped health facilities with uninterrupted SOTA services \uf0a7 Provide reliable access to essential SOTA equipment for healthcare providers Domain: Infrastructure, Products and Technology Strategic Objective: Improve infrastructure at all service delivery facilities to meet the minimum requirements for offering essential SOTA services.

The entire NSOAP governance and accountability structure, which covers all aspects of planning, budgetary allocation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, will be under the supervision of the MoH. Governance and leadership of the NSOAP will include prioritization of the construction of open accountability systems and the promotion of surgical health on the national agenda. This will involve creating a framework for coordination of the NSOAP implementation. Leadership will be at the MoH and GHS (at the National level), and the Regional and District levels for coordination of SOTA care. Accountability responsibilities of operational planning, budgetary allocation as well as monitoring, evaluation and learning will be replicated at all the levels of the health sector. At the National level, the Minister of Health will have the ultimate oversight responsibility for the NSOAP planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. A Steering Committee will be responsible for the operationalization and evaluation of the plan. Additionally, the Steering Committee will be responsible for coordinating activities vertically with all the subnational levels of healthcare sector as well as overseeing horizontal collaboration with partners and other stakeholders. At the Regional, District and health facility levels, coordination and reporting of NSOAP implementation will be done by the Regional and District Health Management Teams in close collaboration with the hospitals.

Financial resources for the NSOAP implementation shall be sourced through existing channels available in the MoH for resource mobilization. Other innovative approaches to resource mobilization should be considered. There is the need to develop a resource mobilization plan which will detail the strategies for attracting funding from the various sources. This strategy will among other things encourage funding by the Government of Ghana where funds from the National budget will be allocated for NSOAP either as a dedicated line item or from existing health sector budget. This NSOAP provides the foundation required for a strong business case for investment in SOTA care in Ghana. Another possible source of funding is allocation of health insurance revenue for NSOAP. Establishment of a fund from motor insurance premium for taking care of specific aspects of the NSOAP shall be actively pursued.

The MoH will assist sector entities whose mandates cover the corresponding areas of strategic intervention with frontline implementation. The promotion and communication of the NSOAP 2025\u20132029 will play a significant role in its implementation.

The population and health professionals will be empowered by the strategy's successful communication and distribution, which will also spark interest in the NSOAP's proposed paradigm change in quality. The MoH will distribute the NSOAP to all agencies, the commercial sector, and important national stakeholders. Additionally, it would be expected of all MoH agencies to set up their respective institutions and organisations to distribute the NSOAP to the relevant stakeholders at their various levels.

The budget was developed based on the key activities under each domain\u2019s strategic objective. The budget estimates are based on assumptions of cost of products, services obtained from key stakeholders and Ghana\u2019s SOTA needs as indicated in the targets. The budget was also developed taking cognizance of the estimated number of SOTA professionals and health facilities required to fill the gaps identified in the needs analysis as well as the number of years of implementation.

In 2006, the Ghana Health Service (GHS) also developed the Health Care Waste Management Policy and Guidelines as a single document. Although awareness on Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) has improved in recent years, there is the need for a systematic approach to improve on effective segregation, safe collection, and storage, as well as ultimate treatment before disposal. This guideline seeks to ensure that HCW is managed effectively in compliance with existing International Conventions that Ghana is a signatory to, national laws and regulations, and others to be passed in future. Recommendations for better management of HCW in the nation's health care facilities have been presented in this document. Also, standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been developed to provide guidance to various levels of the health facilities. Health and safety concerns and guidance have been addressed as part of these guidelines to ensure that managements of institutions put in place measures to limit exposure of their staff and the general public to the hazardous components of health care waste. Responsibilities have been assigned to various units, agencies and stakeholders for efficient and effective implementation of the guidelines. It is hoped that provision will be made for the supply of all necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPE's) and their use enforced during the performance of all activities that potentially generate infectious waste as well as those that go into"}

The need for training to enhance common knowledge of safe HCW management has been outlined. Monitoring and evaluation during the implementation of the waste management systems has also been emphasised. The importance of ensuring the availability of financial resources to make the system function cannot be overemphasized. It is hoped that all facility managers will include waste management in their list of priorities and consequently make necessary budgetary allocations towards capacity building of its staff and secure the tools necessary for efficient waste management on an on-going basis. This document is the outcome of a collaborative effort of personnel of the Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), among others. It is therefore hoped that this collaboration will be enhanced in the application of this guidelines with each organization playing its rightful role in order to give the necessary impetus to ensure proper management of HCW in Ghana.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background Health care facilities generate different kinds of waste during patient care and daily operations which has the potential to contribute to infections among hospital staff, patients, caregivers, and pollution of the environment. The dangers associated with health care waste have contributed to the global attention it has received from many countries and stakeholders. Making a deliberate effort to manage such waste properly to safeguard human health from various risks associated with such waste and protecting environmental integrity is an important public health imperative. Health Care Waste (HCW) includes all solid and liquid waste (both hazardous and non-hazardous) generated related to medical procedures or the performance of medical research involving humans and animals. In addition, it includes the same types of waste originating from minor and scattered sources that are produced in the course of health care undertaken in the home (e.g. home dialysis, self-administration of insulin, recuperative care). The greater percentage of health care waste generated by health facilities are not hazardous (75-90%) and can be managed like domestic/municipal waste whilst the remaining percent (10 - 25 %) is considered hazardous. The hazardous component requires special arrangements for"}

Examples of hazardous health care waste are pathological waste such as tissues and body fluids, pharmaceuticals (expired or unused medicines, etc.), sharps (syringes, disposable scalpels, scalpel blades, etc.), non-sharp infectious waste (swabs, bandages, disposable medical devices etc.), chemicals (solvents, disinfectants, etc.) and radioactive (spent sources of radioactive materials, etc.), nano-medical waste as well as wastewater including effluents from mortuaries. These pose risks either due to their hazardous nature or potential to cause injuries/harm. To help bring about the needed improvement in health care waste management, it is critical to have an up- to-date policy and guidelines for directing best practices among health facilities. In this regard, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Ministry of Health, Ghana, in collaboration with other stakeholders have revised the Health Care Waste Management policy and Guidelines 2006 to reflect current global best practices. The revisions also addressed the concerns and objectives of the Stockholm and Minamata Conventions as well as the Sustainable Development Goals. This document has been developed to help implement the goal of the revised national policy on HCWM (2018). 1.2. Scope This document provides direction to health care facilities in Ghana to comply with the requirement of the Hazardous and Electronic Waste Control and Management Act, 2016 (Act 917) and the revised national policy to ensure safe management of health care waste. This document applies to all health institutions including public, private, quasi-governmental, non-governmental, faith-based and traditional practitioners that operate in the country at all levels of the health care system: Tertiary/Teaching/Specialist Hospitals, Regional Hospitals, District Hospitals and Sub-district Health 2 Institutions (i.e., Health Centres/Clinics and Community Clinics). Others include Health Research Institutions, Laboratories, Home-based Care, Nursing Homes, Alternative Health Care Providers, (including traditional healers and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs)), Dentists, Mortuaries, Funeral Homes and Undertakers, Pharmacies, Veterinary Hospitals"}

The document covers solid and liquid hazardous and non-hazardous health care waste as well as gaseous emissions along the complete logistic chain: procurement, generation, segregation, collection, storage, transport, treatment and disposal. 3 2. CLASSIFICATION AND HEALTH CARE WASTE MANAGEMENT STEPS 2.1. Categories of Health Care Waste Health care waste includes all untreated solid, liquid and gaseous waste (both hazardous and non- hazardous) generated during the administration of medical care, or the performance of medical research involving humans and animals. Generally, between 75-90% of the waste produced by healthcare facilities is non-risk or \u201cgeneral\u201d health care waste, comparable to domestic waste. The remaining 10-25% of health care waste is regarded as hazardous. These guidelines therefore identify two broad categories of health care waste. These are: i. Hazardous Wastes: This refers to waste with properties that make them dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Health care waste is considered hazardous when there is a potential for creating a variety of health risks as a result of actual or presumed biological, chemical and/or radioactive contamination. Due to their potentially hazardous nature, these wastes require special care from their point of generation until final disposal. ii. Non-hazardous or General waste: This is also referred to as domestic or municipal wastes. It includes waste such as paper, fabrics, glass, food residues and containers waste not contaminated with blood, body fluids, or other harmful agents or materials; 2.2. Classification of Health Care Waste The classification system adopted"}
{"source_file": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final.pdf", "chunk_id": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final_10", "text": "is based on the materials that constitute the waste, and the treatment options and method of storage available, as shown in Table 1. These categories are a general guide and are not meant to be all-inclusive and specific to all situations that may be encountered in a health care facility. Therefore, as questionable situations arise, each health care facility must decide if a particular device, material or substance should be regarded as hazardous waste, based on available information and guidance from the Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, Environmental Protection Agency or the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies. Highly infectious waste refers to cultures, waste from autopsies, dead animals' carcasses and other wastes that have been infected or come in contact with risk group 4pathogens (examples are the Marburg, Ebola and Lassa viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever). These highly infectious agents spread from the reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact with infected blood or other body f luids or indirect contact with objects/instruments contaminated. Medical devices such as needles, syringes, personal protective equipment, textiles that have been exposed to such highly infectious agents can equally transmit these agents. Therefore, safe handling, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of waste that is suspected or known to be contaminated with highly infectious agents is of public health importance. 4 Table 1: Classification of Health Care Waste in Ghana TYPE CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION CONTENT/EXAMPLES I HAZARDOUS WASTE These are types of waste from hospitals which may be infectious, toxic or radioactive and therefore require special management. \u2022 A, B, C, D, E, F, G A INFECTIOUS WASTE This refers to health care waste that is suspected to contain pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi) in sufficient concentration or quantity to cause disease in susceptible patients, health care workers and the public."}

All these stages should take place within the facility and are to be followed by transportation to a treatment plant, (on or offsite) and final disposal. The stages in HCWM are summarized in Figure 1. 7 Figure 1: General Steps in Health Care Waste Management NB: For the purpose of this document, external/central storage refers to storage of waste collected from various interim or internal storage points (wards, etc.) and are stored at a point within the health facility before they are transported to the"}

In each institution, the head of the facility must ensure that the steps in the guidelines are followed to ensure adequate collection, treatment, and disposal of the health care waste. Furthermore, micro- planning should be carried out starting from the facility and sub-district levels upwards to the regional level to ensure that the most cost-effective means of collecting, transporting, treating and final disposal of the waste is adopted. HCWM is most effective when proper methods are employed at each step bearing in mind the following considerations: i. The nature of waste, level of toxicity to the environment and risks to health. ii. The quantity of waste generated by each patient daily (kg/bed/day) iii.

For whatever approved reasons treatment options are chosen by a locality. Health care institutions and waste management companies shall ensure that safety and efficiency are not compromised and adverse effects on the environment minimized. 9 3. WASTE PREVENTION AND MINIMISATION OPTIONS Waste prevention and minimisation options for general health care facilities can be classified into source reduction, which can be achieved through material substitution, process or equipment modification or better operating practices; or recycling. Figure 2 shows the details of health care waste management stages which can be adopted to help minimise waste generation. In accordance with the Minamata Convention, health care facilities should not procure mercury- containing thermometers or sphygmomanometers but plan for the introduction of mercury free- alternatives. They also need to ensure the safe collection, handling and environmentally sound disposal of devices to be replaced or substituted. In order to reduce the generation of mercury containing dental waste, the use of mercury containing dental amalgam should be phased down. For example, this can be done by promoting the use of pre-dosed encapsulated forms of amalgam, or amalgam separators, or composite material, all of which can minimize amalgam waste. Approaches to effective reduction in waste generation include improved management oversight, tracking, inventory control, and computerised data base tracking systems. Specific measures include: i. Keep individual waste streams segregated: \u2022 Keep hazardous waste segregated from non-hazardous waste. All waste contaminated with a hazardous substance becomes hazardous. \u2022 Keep hazardous chemical wastes segregated from infectious wastes. \u2022 Keep recyclable waste segregated from non-recyclable waste. \u2022 Minimize hazardous waste quantities by substituting more hazardous products with less hazardous alternatives \u2022 Minimize hazard level of hazardous waste by dilution of hazardous waste. \u2022"}

Ensure that the identity of all chemicals and wastes is clearly marked on all containers. iii. Centralise purchasing and dispensing of medicines and other hazardous chemicals. iv. Monitor drug and chemical flows within the facility from receipt as raw materials to disposal as hazardous wastes. This may be partially or fully automated by the use of computer systems and computer-readable barcoded labels for incoming chemicals, similar to those used in supermarkets. v. Apportion waste management costs to the departments that generate the wastes. vi. Improve inventory control by: \u2022 requiring users of chemicals with limited shelf life to use up old stock before ordering or using new stock (\u201cfirst in first used\u201d). 10 \u2022 procure materials that will result in minimal waste generation. \u2022 ordering hazardous chemicals only when needed and in minimal quantities to avoid out-dated inventory. vii. Employees should be trained in waste prevention and minimisation methods. viii. Implement an institution-wide waste reduction programme. Other approaches to waste minimisation include: i. Requiring that all new materials (cleaning compounds, process chemicals, etc.) that may result in waste generation be tested in small quantities before being purchased in bulk so as to avoid having to dispose of large quantities of unused materials that do not perform as expected. ii. Encouraging drug and chemical suppliers to become responsible partners in a waste minimisation programme by ordering from suppliers who will provide quick delivery of small orders, accept return of unopened stock, and are willing to offer offsite management of hazardous wastes. 3.1.

Waste Prevention and Green Procurement The preferred management option is simply not to produce the waste, by avoiding wasteful ways of working. Waste prevention allows reduction in the costs for purchase of goods and services for both waste treatment and disposal. It also lowers the liabilities associated with the disposal of hazardous waste. Green procurement allows for procuring materials that has reduced environmental and health impacts in the provision of health care services so that waste generated would have minimal environmental consequence and ensure sustainability. This should be factored into procurement of logistics and services for health care delivery. For instance, substituting mercury containing devices with non-mercury devices in which the alternative will have minimal environmental effect as compared to mercury should be seen as green procurement. 13 4. WASTE GENERATION Health care waste is generated from various sources based on the specific operational activities of the unit. These sources can be classified as major or minor. Teaching/Specialist Hospitals, Regional Hospitals, and Research Centres form the major sources. Districts Hospitals, Polyclinics, Private Laboratories, Health Centres/Post, Dental Clinics, Pharmacies, Veterinary, Maternity Homes, and Alternative Health Care Providers form the minor sources. The quantity and type of waste produced depends on type of health care facility, the level of services offered, the capacity of the hospital and number of people utilizing the available services. i. Facilities should take the necessary steps to know the quantities of waste generated by the departments and units for proper planning of resources needed to manage them. ii. Records should be kept for the departments and units by weighing the quantities or measuring the volumes of waste generated by assigned staff. iii.

Departments generating more waste should plan through waste minimization strategies (segregation, recycling, proper procurement, etc.) to reduce the quantities appropriately. For effective planning, each level of the health care system should make an assessment of their waste generation. This includes all wastes generated during clinical care (including surgery), routine and mass immunization. v. The assessments should be collated by the District Health Management Teams (DHMT) in each district to obtain the district waste generated and further, by the Regional Health Management Teams (RHMT) to estimate regional level waste generation. The regions should then submit returns on these levels quarterly to GHS headquarters. The Teaching Hospitals and GHS should submit their returns to the MOH, or an appropriate body or department designated by the MOH, which should further collate the statistics into a composite estimate of the national health care waste.

There is the need to segregate health care waste into the various sub-categories at the point of generation for safety reasons and to facilitate minimisation as well as an application of appropriate treatment and disposal methods. ii. Handling, treatment and disposal of waste by sub-category will help to reduce costs as the type of waste influences the disposal method used, hence disposal costs. Non-segregation of the waste renders all clinical waste generated infectious or hazardous and results in higher management costs and higher environmental effects. iii. Segregation should be done at source; that is, as close as possible to the point of generation of the waste and should always be the responsibility of the waste producer. iv. Each waste stream segregated must be placed in an appropriately colour-coded container as stipulated in the guidelines under colour coding with the correct hazard symbol as indicated in Appendix 6. v. Instruction posters regarding the procedure for waste segregation (as shown in the SOP) should be pasted in all areas where segregation takes place and other vantage points to remind staff and inform users of the facility on correct or proper segregation requirements. vi. There shall be affixed to every waste a label which indicates the classification or the content of the segregated waste to aid further handling. vii. All health care facilities shall train their staff on health care waste definition, classification and segregation periodically. Health care waste management training should be incorporated and strengthened in both pre-service"}

Containment Segregated waste should be properly contained at the point of generation in a suitable storage container that fit the characteristics of the type of health care waste. Containment at the point of generation should be considered as an important first step in getting the waste into their rightful categories for onward handling by assigned staff. For example, sharps are to be contained in puncture proof containers to prevent accidental injuries among waste handlers and keep the hospital environment clean and safe. Containment should be done to conform to the colour coding system and appropriate signage's approved by this guidelines and regulation on health care waste management in the country. The following measures should be taken to ensure safe management of waste at the points of generation: i. 40-60 litres pedal bins are recommended for containerisation of general and infectious waste at the wards. 16 ii. Rigid containers should be lined with colour coded plastic bags at the opening folding outward over the rim to plastic bags to minimize contamination of the surrounding. The top of the container should have a wider diameter than the base; iii. Storage time shall be reduced as much as practicable but not longer than one day. Multiple daily removals of the waste is recommended. Sharp waste containers shall be removed when \u00be (75%) full. iv. Disposable bags for infectious waste shall be of the appropriate size with a minimum of 570 microns and maximum of 100 microns in thickness; v.

Colour Coding and Labelling Colour coding of waste containers and plastic bags is one of the efficient ways of achieving segregation of waste and for sorting out items such as paper, plastic, glass and metal for recycling. In this case, it helps to segregate infectious and non-infectious waste for proper treatment and disposal. The recommended colour coding scheme for Ghana is as follows: BLACK - General waste (e.g. kitchen waste, paper, cardboard, sweepings etc) YELLOW - Infectious waste (e.g. patient waste, sharps, and cultures/specimens) with the biohazard label - Radioactive waste with the radioactive symbol to conform with new UN symbols) RED - Pathological waste and highly infectious waste BROWN - Non-infectious hazardous waste (e.g. expired medicines, vaccines, chemicals, etc.) Table 3 shows the colour coding for the storage container and the appropriate labelling.

STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION 6.1. Storage Storage refers to the manner in which the waste is contained during the time lapse between its generation and collection for final disposal. This is classified into Internal Storage and External/Central Storage. Consideration for storage must be based on the classification or type of waste being dealt with and the potential risk of infection to healthcare workers and waste disposal staff. Labels on containers should be permanent and legible for the entire storage period. 6.1.1. Internal Storage (On-site storage) Internal storage is the temporary placement of packaged and labelled waste collected from the source of generation into colour coded containers (trolley bins) at designated places outside the working area or at a utility room before transfer to external storage points and should not exceed 24 hours. Internal storage considerations should be based on the classification or type of waste being dealt with and the potential risk of infection to healthcare workers and waste disposal staff.

Waste stored at this area should be transported to the treatment point or external/central storage area within 24 hours to avoid spillage and overloading of trolley or waste bins. iii. Infectious and hazardous waste shall be segregated at the point of origin rather than at the transfer or external storage site to facilitate appropriate packaging, colour coding, and transportation; 6.1.2. External/Central Storage External/Central storage refers to the transit point where waste is stored after removal from internal storage (from different wards or departments) to the time it is collected and transported for treatment onsite and final disposal offsite. The frequency of removal of waste stored depends on the volume and nature of waste generated. Where treatment facility is located in the facility, the central/external storage should be done in the waste management area where the treatment plant is located. The external/central storage location for health care waste should be designated within the health care facility. Space for external storage should be incorporated into a building design when new construction is undertaken. These storage areas should be sized according to the quantities of waste to be generated and the frequency of collection. These areas must be totally enclosed and separated from supply rooms or food preparation areas. Only authorised staff should have access to the waste storage areas.

It should be collected at least every week. Segregated general waste with potential for recycling should be handed over to recycling companies or buyers. The storage area should be enclosed, paved and connected to a public road. The gate should be big enough that the collection vehicles can enter. ii. Infectious and sharp waste storage The storage place must be identifiable as the infectious waste area by using the biohazard symbol. Floor and walls should be sealed or tiled to allow easy cleaning and disinfection. Storage times for infectious waste (e.g., the time gap between generation and treatment) should not exceed the following periods: - Warm climate: 48 hours during the cool temperature/ 24 hours during the hot temperature. - If a refrigerated storage room is available, infectious waste can be stored for m o r e than a week at a temperature no higher than 3\u00b0 C to 8\u00b0 C. iii.

The classification should be carried out by a pharmacist or another expert on pharmaceuticals. Waste from cytotoxic medicines should be separated and stored in leak-proof bags or containers and labelled for easy identification and collection. v. Storage of Radioactive waste Radioactive waste should be stored in compliance with national regulations and in consultation with the Radiation Officer and Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC). It should be placed in containers that prevent dispersion of radiation and stored behind lead shielding. 22 Radioactive waste should be stored in containers that prevent dispersion of radiation and stored behind lead shielding. Waste that is to be stored during radioactive decay should be labelled with the type of radionuclide, date, period before full decay and details of required storage conditions. The decay storage time for radioactive waste differs from other waste storage as the main target will be to store the waste until the radioactivity is substantially reduced and the waste can be safely disposed of as normal waste. A minimum storage time of 10 half-life-times for radioisotopes in wastes with a half- life of <90 days is a common practice. Infectious radioactive waste should be decontaminated prior to disposal. Sharp objects such as needles, Pasteur pipettes, and broken glass should be placed in a sharp container.

HEALTH CARE WASTE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL METHODS Treatment of health care waste is very important for ensuring a break in transmission of potentially infectious agents from the waste to susceptible persons; make it easy and safe for disposal. The overall objective of HCW treatment is to reduce the potential hazard posed by health care waste and to protect the environment. From the waste hierarchy, treatment is next to disposal, implying that all measure for minimization should be adopted to reduce the amount of waste substantially so that treatment will focus on the potentially infectious waste. After treatment, the treated waste (residue) should be properly packaged as indicated by the appropriate SOP for land disposal, preferably at a landfill site. 7.1. Overview of HCW Treatment Technologies 7.1.1. Thermal processes The traditional treatment technology that has been used over long time and across the globe has been based on thermal processes. These processes rely on heat to destroy pathogenic organism in the waste. There are two main categories of such treatment method which are low-heat and high-heat designs. Examples of low-heat thermal processes include autoclaves, microwaves, etc. whilst high-heat options include incinerators, pyrolysis and gasification. The non-incineration treatment technology options (e.g."}
{"source_file": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final.pdf", "chunk_id": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final_33", "text": "autoclave, hydroclave, etc.) which do not cause any adverse health and environmental effects are preferred to low temperature incinerators that have been found to be polluting the environment with dioxins and furans (e.g. De-Montfort incinerators). Irradiation treatment processes encompasses designs using irradiation from electron beams, cobalt-60 or ultraviolet sources. 7.1.2. Chemical processes Chemical treatment methods use disinfectants such as dissolved chlorine dioxide, bleach (sodium hypochlorite), peracetic acid, lime solution, ozone gas or dry inorganic chemicals (e.g. calcium oxide powder). The processes often involve shredding, grinding or mixing to increase exposure of the waste to the chemical agent. Besides chemical disinfectants, there are also encapsulating compounds that can solidify sharps, blood or other body fluids within a solid matrix before disposal. Another example of a chemical process is a system that uses heated alkali to digest tissues, pathological waste. 7.1.3. Biological processes These processes utilize natural living organisms to degrade organic matter component of HCW under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Biological treatment systems can use enzymes to speed up the destruction of organic waste containing pathogens. The natural decomposition of pathological waste through burial is another example of a biological process. One example for a biological treatment method are the Bio-digesters. These are normally designed to allow for decomposition of organic waste under anaerobic conditions (without oxygen) which results in fermentation to produce methane gas. Pathological waste which is organic in nature can be treated in conjunction with other organic waste from 28 the kitchen and wastewater in a bio-digester to harness gas to supplement energy needs of the health facility. The digester can be made of metal fabricated to specifications or constructed using burnt bricks also to specifications. Waste such as plastics, bottles and other non-biodegradable materials should not be put into bio-digesters. To operate such facility efficiently, the following"}

If necessary, water can be added to reach the desired moisture content. \u2022 The digester should be seeded with animal dung to provide enough anaerobic bacterial to start the decomposition activity. \u2022 Parameters such as C:N ratio [1:25 or 1:30], water content, temperature [thermophilic range (55\u201370 \u00b0C)], and pH which are critical to the performance of anaerobic digestion systems should be regularly monitored. \u2022 Periodic inspection and maintenance of the digester is important to ensure it efficient functioning. 7.1.4. Mechanical processes Mechanical treatment processes include several shredding, grinding, mixing and compaction technologies that reduce waste volume, although they cannot destroy pathogens. In most instances, mechanical processes are not stand-alone health-care waste-treatment processes, but supplement other treatment methods such as autoclaving, chemical treatment, etc. 7.2. Overview of HCW Treatment Approaches In general, there are three approaches for the treatment of HCW: i. On-site (OS) treatment \u2013 This the simplest and the commonest treatment approach where a healthcare facility treats its own waste using its treatment technology within its premises. The hospital does not receive waste from other facilities and therefore, operation and maintenance cost are the responsibility of the facility. Mostly, the capacity of the treatment technology is selected to meet the healthcare waste generation capacity of the health facility. ii. Cluster treatment (Cluster) \u2013 This approach is where a hospital treats its waste plus waste from other health facilities in a small area. This can be done within a sub-metro, metropolis, and municipalities or a defined area using facilities within a certain radius"}
{"source_file": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final.pdf", "chunk_id": "NATIONAL-GUIDELINES-FOR-HEALTH-Final_35", "text": "of the treatment hospital or site. This approach allows for a number of facilities to leverage on existing treatment technology in another facility to treat healthcare waste at an agreed fee among the facilities or free based on the hierarchy of health service. That is, a district hospital hosting the treatment technology can accept to treat infectious healthcare waste from polyclinics, clinics, health centres, CHPS, private health facility, etc. for free or at agreed fee. The benefits include reduced operation and maintenance cost to the facilities involved 29 in the cluster. However, the challenges include the difficulties of transporting infectious waste and unwillingness to pay agreed fees for treatment which may shift the burden to the hosting health facility or make the system unsustainable. Therefore, the terms for involvement in the cluster operations should be clearly spelt out. iii. Central Treatment (CT) \u2013 This is where a dedicated treatment plant with larger treatment capacity collects and treats wastes from many health facilities in an urban centre or at the regional level. This approach is more suitable for private sector companies to be involved in healthcare waste collection and treatment services. The private sector will establish and operate such treatment facility for profit and in compliance with existing laws, polices and regulations. The benefits to the health sector are enormous since health facilities would avoid the challenges of meeting regulatory standards for treatment, transportation, operation and maintenance challenges but pay for services. The cost of setting-up a number of such treatments technologies at each facility is avoided and funds can be deployed to address other needs. This will ensure sustainability of the operation of such treatment technologies and contribute to safe healthcare waste management in Ghana. 7.3. Evaluation of Treatment Options The guidelines accept any of the available treatment technologies utilizing"}

The recommended options for HCW treatment technologies that can be adopted for various waste streams are provided in Table 4 to guide each level of health institutions. They are based on technology available, their environmental friendliness and cost considerations. Where the treatment technology (e.g. autoclaves, incinerators, etc.) has the capacity to handle more waste than the individual institution generates, it can be strategically located to serve more than one institution for optimization and cost reduction (e.g. cluster or central treatment). With regards to HCW treatment approaches, the recommendations are that, where the volume of waste generated is minimal, segregation and transportation of waste to a cluster or central treatment facility may be much cheaper than procuring treatment technologies for a facility. Such considerations are important for facilitating the rational use of resources. This necessitates a process of micro planning at all levels. There are various health care waste treatment technology options. The treatment option should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the following factors which shall be integrated into the comprehensive framework of healthcare waste management plan.

The choice of disposal option depends greatly on availability of space and/or adequate facilities to ensure the minimisation of risk to public health and the environment. 7.4.1. Landfilling in Municipal Disposal Sites Treated health care waste may be landfilled with municipal waste. However, health care waste should not be deposited or scattered on the surface of open dumps and must be protected to prevent access by scavengers. It may be deposited in one of the following two ways: \u2022 In a deeper pit (1-2 m) excavated in mature municipal waste (at least 3 months since being landfilled) which is then filled back with the mature waste that was dug out. Scavenging in this part of the site must be prevented. \u2022 In a shallow hollow excavated pit in mature municipal waste immediately in front of the base of the working face (the surface where waste is being tipped). After deposit the waste should be covered the dame day. Scavenging should be prevented. In case of a disease outbreak involving especially virulent pathogens (such as cholera), an intermediate layer of both lime and soil cover must be added before fill back with mature waste.

Contaminated body tissue can be treated using alkaline digestion in designed pits. To dispose of any human tissue or body part, it is important for the officer in-charge of the facility and at the waste management unit to satisfy her/himself of the approval to dispose of such waste. These approval issues should include among other things: \u2022 the details of body part to be disposed of. \u2022 brief information of patient to allow for easy records and identification. \u2022 a written and signed consent letter or form from patient or representative before disposing such waste. Health facilities should liaise with the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to designate a place for disposal or safe burial of such waste.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL Wastewater from Health Care Facilities is of similar quality to urban wastewater but may also contain various potentially hazardous components if the recommendations in Table 4 are not followed. Hazardous components of wastewater from Healthcare Facilities include the following: i. Bacteria, viruses and helminths discharged from treating patients with infectious diseases. ii. Hazardous chemicals from cleaning and disinfection operations. iii. Pharmaceuticals from pharmacies and various wards/units. iv. Radioactive isotopes. Wastewater in category (i) and other general liquid effluents should be connected to the sewerage system if available, or to other technically sound on-site systems. However, during epidemics or where highly infectious patients are involved, high risk type wastes should be pre-treated by chemical disinfection before disposal. Waste in categories ii, iii and iv must be segregated and treated appropriately with best available treatment options like wastewater treatment plants or in underground drainage system with addition of strong disinfectant such as 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for a contact time of 30 minutes. The use of bio-digesters is an option for treatment of wastewater from toilets and latrines. Wastewater from kitchens and biodegradable potentially infectious waste can also be handled via this means. It is however not advisable to treat other"}

The biogas (methane) produced may be used in kitchen appliances (stoves and refrigerators). The recommended treatment option for many chemical wastes such as vaccines (liquid) is high temperature incineration (Table 4). Currently, there is no or limited treatment facility for such wastes. For the long term, efforts will be made to acquire at least one suitable incinerator for their treatment. Until then, disposal of liquid chemical wastes will comprise dilution with large volumes of water, neutralization (where indicated) and washing down the drain. Chemical decontamination is to be used for organic substances and solvents. 8.1.Connection to a Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant Without Pre-treatment It may be acceptable to discharge the sewage of Health Care Facilities to municipal sewers without pre- treatment, provided that the following requirements are met: \u2022 Municipal sewers are connected to efficiently operated sewage treatment plants that ensure at least 95% removal of bacteria. \u2022 The sludge resulting from sewage treatment is subjected to composting or anaerobic digestion leaving no more than one helminth egg per litre in the digested sludge. \u2022 The waste management system of the health institution maintains high standards ensuring that significant quantities of toxic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc. are not discharged into 39 sewers. \u2022 Excreta from patients being treated with cytotoxic medicines are collected separately as far as possible and adequately treated. 8.2.On-site treatment of wastewater If the requirements in connection to a municipal sewage treatment plant cannot be met, an efficient on- site management system should be established. This could be a septic tank and soak away, sedimentation tanks with aerators, or a waste stabilisation pond system. If a septic tank and soak away are to be used, the septic tank must be adequately dimensioned to ensure good solids removal to guarantee trouble-free operation of the"}

It may be landfilled but should on no account be used for agricultural purposes. 8.3.Minimal Safety Requirements \u2022 Sewage from health care establishments should never be used for agricultural or aquaculture purposes. \u2022 Hospital sewage should not be discharged into natural water bodies that are used to irrigate fruit or vegetable crops, to produce drinking water, or for recreational purposes. \u2022 Healthcare facilities that are not in the position to afford a wastewater treatment system should isolate patients with enteric diseases in wards where their excreta can be collected in appropriate containers for appropriate chemical disinfection; for example, this is of utmost importance in cases of cholera outbreaks. \u2022 No chemicals or pharmaceuticals should be discharged into the sewer. \u2022 Small-scale rural health care establishments that apply minimal waste management programmes must discharge their treated wastewater into a soakaway. However, this must take place outside the catchment area of aquifers used to produce drinking-water or to supply water to the health care establishment. 40 9.

A ready supply of all necessary equipment must be in place for use whenever such an event occurs. It is important that information and training for staff is provided prior to any such eventuality. The aim of a spillage procedure is to: i. Contain the spillage. ii. Limit the escape iii. Protect staff, patients and visitors. Protect the environment. iv. Have persons move away from the area of spillage. Restore the area to normalcy as quickly as possible. v. Minimize the effect of the spillage on normal service provision. 9.2.Procedure for handling Spillage of infectious waste The main risk is that of cross infection, and the procedure consists of donning protective clothing consistent with the risk, in most cases disposable gloves, and apron if appropriate, and placing the waste items into the appropriate yellow bag; or into a sharps box in the case of needles, blades or other sharp items, taking special care not to receive a sharps injury. Sharps must not be retrieved by hand. The following guidelines shall therefore apply: i. Staff cleaning spills shall wear protective clothing suitable for the spillage at hand. ii. Standard cleaning equipment including a mop and cleaning bucket plus cleaning agents shall be readily available for spills management and shall be stored and sign-posted in an area known to all staff. iii.

Large spills of cultures or concentrated infectious agents shall also be flooded with high-level disinfectant (e.g. Bleach) before cleaning and then decontaminated with fresh disinfectant. 9.3.Procedure for handling Spillage of chemical waste The essential steps are: i. Contain the spillage to prevent further spread. ii. Prevent exposure of: a. Other persons in the vicinity. b. Staff dealing with the spill. iii. Absorb and dispose as quickly as possible. iv. Decontaminate the area and return it to normal use. Similar principles apply to any other chemical spillage. For chemicals like glutaraldehyde which readily evaporate to produce very irritant fumes, a respirator designed for use with organic vapours should be worn. The liquid should be mopped up as quickly as possible with absorbent, disposable materials, which must then be double bagged and removed to the open- air waste storage compounds as soon as possible. The area of the spill should be well ventilated and will require sufficient time for the vapour to disperse before being reoccupied. Mercury is another chemical whose handling should be mentioned. The main risk is that of skin absorption on contact with mercury, and by inhalation of mercury vapour which may slowly vaporise into the air from exposed surfaces of mercury.

HEALTH AND SAFETY The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development through the District Assemblies jointly with the Ministry of Health and its implementing agencies as well as other corporate and individual employers within the health sector are responsible for providing the necessary resources for correct and effective health care waste management. Managers in healthcare facilities and other organizations are expected to provide safe systems of work for staff generating, handling, storing, transporting, treating and carrying out final disposal of waste. They are to institute a system of regular medical screening for communicable diseases and immunizations for all staff involved in waste management. These should include Hepatitis B and C, tetanus, HIV (optional), etc. They are to provide appropriate information and training for all relevant staff. They are to conduct regular monitoring and periodic reviews of the system, so that deficiencies are corrected within a reasonable timescale and the system continuously improved in the light of experience gained.

Besides this, annual reports shall be prepared by each health institution and copies sent to the representative EPA Regional office and District Assembly of the institution. The annual report must also contain a section on waste management. 10.2.Enforcement and Compliance Health Facilities Regulatory Agency (HeFRA) shall ensure enforcement and compliance with legislations. The internal activities of the health facilities that can compromise on quality of service delivery are therefore expected to be monitored by the Agency as part of their regulatory activities. The Agency shall therefore monitor operational activities of healthcare facilities as set out by 45 Act 829 to ensure the safe management of health care waste within health facilities. District Assemblies shall assign responsibility for monitoring and controlling health care waste management activities outside the hospitals to the Environmental Health and Waste Management Department, with the aim of establishing long-term sustainability in health care waste management.

TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING Capacity refers to the capabilities (knowledge and skills) available to the health care facility for health care delivery. It includes a mix of technical and managerial capacity required to promote, protect and improve health. It is essential that the right calibre of personnel is recruited to supervise waste management activities in the health facilities. It is essential that training in the safe and correct management of health care waste is provided to health care workers and waste handlers. Health facilities should: i. Develop training materials on health care waste management to facilitate pre- service and in- service training. The material should be easy to understand and not too technical to confuse people. ii. Incorporate health care waste management in pre-service and in-service training of health workers. Orientation programmes for newly recruited staff of health facilities should include health care waste management to prepare new staff for the job. Annual training programmes should include health care waste management to re- enforce the proper health care waste management practices in old staff. iii. Ensure all staff undergo in-service training in health care waste management.

The plan should also address issues of management and the allocation of resources. Surveys on the generation of waste will be the basis for identifying opportunities and setting targets for waste minimisation, reuse, recycling, reduction in cost and the potential liabilities associated with handling, transport and disposal. Each facility shall develop a contingency plan to provide guidance to waste management and other staff as well as visitors to facilities on measures to be implemented in the event of unexpected incidents. This plan is to include among others measures to manage spillages, fire, flooding and other hazards peculiar to the locality. Health care waste management involves more than one sector. Inter-sectorial collaboration is therefore necessary for the effectiveness of the implementation of the programmes since the key players come from different ministries with their individual command structure. Various emergency/contingency plans should be in line with the national Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) emergency response plan. 12.2. Levels of Health Care Waste Implementation The following constitute implementation actions to be instituted at various levels of the health care system: 12.2.1. Institutional Level At the institutional level, each facility shall establish a HCWMC preferably led by the head of the institution to supervise advice and manage HCW. The membership of the HCWMC shall comprise the Head of the institution, the Environmental Health Officer and three other senior officers (preferably Heads of relevant departments involved in generating or handling waste in the facility). 49 12.2.2.

Financing Each health institution is financially liable for the safe management of the HCW it generates. Health Care Facilities therefore need to assess the costs of HCW management and how these can be reliably met. Costs can be divided into several categories as follows: 1. Capital costs which comprise equipment acquisition and installation. Recurrent costs: a) Labour and supplies for segregation and labelling, collecting, packaging and handling, internal treatment and storage b) Operation and maintenance of equipment and facilities 53 2. Provision of services by contractors who provide services like external transport, treatment, recycling or final disposal of HCW. Each of these cost build-up elements must be separately estimated, based on actual data rather than guesswork or a simple factoring of the previous year's budget. In order to gather such data, detailed and accurate accounting records must be kept and analysed regularly. Hidden costs such as depreciation should also be taken into account, especially where a service is to be undertaken by the private sector. Once costs for the planning period are estimated, a financing plan should be drawn up. This must be realistic and achievable. Because HCW management must be done reliably and continuously, it is not advisable to rely on subventions from local or national government, but rather on internally generated fund by the health care facility itself. However, alternative sources of funding may be needed for major investments. Such funding may be solicited from the following: \u2022 Private sector \u2022 Central government \u2022 Multilateral/Bilateral Donors \u2022 NGOs 12.9.

No matter how well a programme is planned and implemented, there are chances that some details may be overlooked. Effective control of HCW and monitoring of activities and operational state of facilities should be carried out regularly and systematically, in order to maintain and improve its management. Measures should be adopted to ensure that problems and risks involved are identified and pre-empted while enhancing safety. Though the HCWM committees are to advise on the on the management of HCW, daily supervision is to be carried out by the HCW control manager (line manager of labourers and auxiliary staff involved in HCW management) who in tum is answerable to the head of the institution. The institutional heads therefore have overall responsibility for ensuring that procedures are in place, are being implemented and sanctions enforced where appropriate. They are expected to work closely with the HCWM committee which they (or their representative) chair and conduct regular spot checks to ensure compliance. In addition to daily and weekly inspections of procedures, the following parameters are to be monitored: i. Adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) which help to operationalize these guidelines for persons involved at each stage of handling waste should be monitored frequently by supervisors in the health facility, by the DHMTS and the RHMTS. The SOPs cover areas like HCW minimization, segregation and labelling, transportation, storage, treatment and final disposal. In addition, it should cover the disinfection of reusable health care risk waste containers based on standards for disinfection as required by this guideline. ii.

They also provide the opportunity to review the plans as well as training programmes in order to make them more effective. Periodic reviews are also important in assessing program impact. Thus, the effectiveness of the programmes will be assessed from both the point of view of management processes and programme impacts. 56 13.2. Auditing 13.2.1 Periodic Internal Management Audit Each regional directorate should arrange to carry out its own internal audit on HCW management practices in their facilities at least once annually, and follow up any serious incident which is relevant to HCW management procedures. This is in an effort to amend procedures where appropriate in order to improve the management of the HCW. The results of the audit should be forwarded to GHS / MOH headquarters and communicated to health institutions involved. 13.2.2 External Random Audit Random audits on HCW management will be carried out each year by the GHS / MOH which may delegate the Occupational and Environmental Health Unit, Institutional Care Division or other appropriate department to carry out this function on its behalf. Additionally, audits offered by audit bodies external to the GHS/MOH will be encouraged, to facilitate objective evaluations which favour comparisons with international norms on HCW management. 13.2.3 Audit Tool Audit tools designed for measuring compliance with clinical waste procedures should be used for audits.

Improving Health care waste management will contribute to meeting Ghana's obligation towards achieving Goal 3- good health and well-being, Goal 6 -clean water and sanitation, Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, and Goal 13 - climate action. Brief Profile of the health facility Jama Nkorso Hospital is a privately owned hospital registered under the sole proprietorship arrangement of Registrar Generals regulation as required by Act 123. The hospital which was registered on the 24th June 2017 is yet to begin full operation due to some regulatory requirements which are dully completed. The hospital is considered as a primary hospital based on the classification scheme operation and service. The facility is established to provide general health care services such as OPD services, maternity, accident and emergency services, paediatric and morgue operations. The hospital is a 30-bed capacity with potential for expansion. Organizational Structure The hospital is headed by the Chief Executive who I the owner of the facility. Directly under him is the Medical Director who is responsible for all the clinical activities in the hospital, an administrator for the daily operation of the hospital head of nursing and unit heads. Unit heads report to their respective heads as Clinical or Administrative head. Organization of HCWM in Health Facility Waste management activities are structured under the"}

The hospital does not 67 have any treatment facility except pathological pit and therefore would engage the services of private waste company for waste collection, treatment and disposal. Waste generation Jama Nkorso Hospital is expected to generate both solid and liquid waste from the operational activities. The solid healthcare waste shall consist of the hazardous and non-hazardous waste categories. The hazardous materials would normally include the sub-categories listed as follows: \u2022 Sharps - e.g., used needles, syringes, scalpels, surgical blades, etc. \u2022 Pathological - e.g., placenta, body parts, etc. \u2022 Infectious waste \u2013 e.g., laboratory cultures, stocks, blood specimen, blood socked cotton wool, soiled bedding materials, etc. \u2022 Chemical waste \u2013 acids, bases, formaldehydes, hypochlorite, etc. \u2022 Pharmaceutical waste \u2013 expired medicines, broken medicines in syrup forms, etc. The non-hazardous or general waste expected to be generated are then recyclable (clean plastic bottles, papers, carton boxes, etc.) and non-recyclable (soiled plastics, papers, etc.) a) Liquid waste \u2022 Wastewater from sinks, hand washing basins, wash rooms \u2022 Wastewater suspected to contain pathogenic organisms \u2022 Wastewater from toilet systems (Black water) Estimated Quantities of Waste to be generated \u2022 Sharps: It is estimated that about 20 litre of sharp waste shall be produced per week from operational activities. \u2022 Pathological waste: Delivery rate is estimated to peak at 20 deliveries per week which should produce approximately 30 kg of placenta (1.5kg per delivery by 20 deliveries).

The revision has been informed by the need to strengthen pharmaceutical systems as a key component of health systems to meet the ever-changing health needs of the population. The urgent need to develop the local pharmaceutical industry to be responsive to health needs and ensure access to medicines for the poor and vulnerable also guided the revision. It is also driven by the Government\u2019s medium-term development strategy as outlined by the National Development Planning Commission, the Health Sector Medium-Term Strategy, the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines for drug policy development and supply chain reforms in the health sector. This policy covers broad areas such as selection, strategic purchasing, global trade and research and development, use of medicines, quality assurance and governance. New sections include health technology assessment, patient safety, risk management and good governance. In highlighting these areas, due cognizance has been given to available resources, potential benefit of medicines in disease management and the socio-economic environment. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 5 This document has been developed following a critical analysis of the evidence available and several consultations with stakeholders in the health and other sectors, in order to ensure a coherent and multi-sectoral approach for achieving the objectives of the national medicines policy. The revised medicines policy shall therefore remain the official policy to guide the pharmaceutical sector in Ghana. It shall be implemented through an implementation plan, a communication and advocacy strategy and a framework for monitoring and evaluation. I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Technical Working Group of Experts, the Parliamentary Select Committee on Health, World Health Organization, United Nations Development Programme and other stakeholders whose immense contributions and support have made the review of this policy a success.

The key strategic areas of the national health policy considered in this policy include bridging equity gaps in geographic access to health services, ensuring sustainable financing for healthcare delivery, improving efficiency in governance and management, intensified prevention and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and improving quality of health services delivery including mental health. The document is also situated within the Ghana Health Sector Medium Term Plan, 2010-2013 and 2014-2017, with the goal of having a healthy and productive population that reproduces itself safely. (Ghana Ministry of Health, 2010-2013) (Ghana Ministry of Health, 2014-2017) Based on an external independent assessment of the implementation of the 2nd edition 2004 drug policy in 2013, about 50% of the 60 key policy components of the 2004 policy are on track and that one third are at risk; and that in a small number of policy areas no action has been taken.

There is the need to further improve efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector, through (1) improved procurement with economies of scale as well as quality assurance, and (2) improved analysis and processing of claims by the NHIS, to impact positively on prescribing and medicine costs. These necessary improvements as well as other policy interventions would ensure sustainable access to medicines in view of current health dynamics. New areas to this document are based on global trends in health and pharmaceuticals and include Health Technology Assessment (HTA), risk management, governance and transparency, pricing, disposal of medicines and related health technologies. This National Medicines Policy (NMP) focuses on strengthening key areas in the pharmaceutical sector, including public procurement, the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), active monitoring and correction of prescribing behavior in line with Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG), and support to the local pharmaceutical industry within public health goals. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 13 CHAPTER 2 SELECTION OF MEDICINES AND OTHER HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES 2.1 SELECTION OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES AND HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES Preamble The selection of essential medicines for use in the country is crucial to the success of the main aim of making available, medicines of the required efficacy, safety and quality to the people. The selection must be evidence- based, the medicines must be the most cost-effective in their therapeutic group, and must reflect the demographic and economic situation prevailing in the country. This implies that attention will first be put on basic essential medicines for all people, before expensive medicines are selected, which may only benefit a small proportion of the population. The selection of medicines will also take into account the different skills of prescribers at different levels of health care.

The 2010 version was used as the basis for the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) reimbursement list (National Health Insurance Authority, 2010). The 2010 EML contains 334 medicines in 725 formulations, and was developed on the basis of the STGs (Ministry of Health-Ghana National Drugs Programme, 2010). Not all medicines listed on the STGs are included in the EML, and not all EML medicines are reimbursed by the NHIS. The current EML specifies the approved level of use and recommends the NHIS reimbursement status. The EML lists medicines National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 14 by their generic names or International Nonproprietary Name (INNs). (Ministry of Health-Ghana National Drugs Programme, 2010) The EML 2010 uses only INNs in the procedures and criteria in place for updating the EML. There is a National Medicines Selection Committee with many contributors with a subgroup for evidence synthesis. Procedures and selection criteria are published with the EML. National disease control programmes are very positive about the inclusion of their (often changing) treatment guidelines in the STGs and EML. The production of the STGs takes much time and printing is very expensive. A 2008 survey revealed that 75% and 95% of facilities had copies of the 4th edition of STGs and EML respectively (Arhinful, Annan, & Gyansa- Lutterodt, 2009). The 5th edition of the STG and EML are available on the GNDP website (www.ghndp.org). About 17,000 copies of the STGs were distributed to all cadres of health professionals, students from health training institutions, NHIS claims managers etc. However, the number of copies in circulation is insufficient.

If information on existing medicines shows they no longer have a favourable risk/benefit ratio, they shall be deleted and replaced with better alternatives. 2.2 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENTS Preamble Health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process that summarizes information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, and robust manner (World Health Organisation, 2015). Its aim is to inform the formulation of safe, effective, health policies that are patient-focused and seek to achieve best value. HTA must always be firmly rooted in research and the scientific method. Situation analysis Health Technology Assessment is not yet developed in Ghana. The selection of essential medicines is being done in a relatively systematic way, but is not informed by HTA. There is much potential for HTA to identify the most cost-effective diagnostic, preventive and curative interventions as well as support reimbursement decisions on vaccines, medicines, screening and preventive programmes. (Hans, Cecile, & Annan, 2013). Policy objective To strengthen the science and practice of HTA in support of evidence- based reimbursement decisions for the government and the NHIS.

Vaccines and medicines may play an important role in treating and containing the disease. Situation analysis The Ebola outbreak of 2014/2015 was a wake-up call for many governments globally, as the disease with a mortality of 60-90%, spread much more quickly and widely than on previous occasions. Although no treatment is available, the international vaccine industry was quick in developing and testing a new vaccine for rapid use. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 18 Policy objectives To ensure the rapid registration, procurement and distribution of any new vaccine, medicine and related-health technologies needed for the treatment and containment of an emerging disease.

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 19 CHAPTER 3 STRATEGIC PURCHASING 3.1 FINANCING Preamble In recent years, government has implemented important policies towards achieving universal health coverage for all people in Ghana. This has implied considerable and annually increasing financial investments in health. In order to sustain the system, careful planning of financial investments and continuous attention to cost-containment are needed. Situation analysis The MOH with support from development partners centrally procures anti-retroviral (ARVs), psychotropics, family planning products and vaccines. Most of the ARVs and the TB medicines (90%) are donations and/or products received through the voluntary pooled procurement mechanism from Global Fund and the Global Drug Facility (GDF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u2013 President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI); the rest are paid for by the MOH or GHS. The MOH centrally procures very few general essential medicines, and mostly in insufficient quantities. In May 2013, only 27 out of a sample of 100 general EML-listed products for maternal and child health (MCH) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were in stock, plus 7 non-listed alternatives (usually different strengths of EML medicines). General essential medicines are largely procured by the RMS directly; and to a lesser extent by tertiary and district facilities themselves. The absence of central procurement of general EM leads to inefficiencies in price through loss of economies of scale, and"}

Until recently, medicines for children <5 and the elderly were supplied National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 20 free, against erratic reimbursement or replenishment by the CMS. This situation has drastically improved by the introduction of the health insurance with free medicines listed on the EML. Some programme medicines are supplied free of charge like ARVs and TB medicines (see above). Since the NHIS was established, coverage has increased to 62% of the population in 2010, and to 80-95% of consultations in public facilities in 2013. Over 50% of NHIS expenditure is on medicines and medical products. The insurance package is perceived by some as too generous in relation to the available funds, creating a sustainability risk. For example, in 2012 the World Bank estimated that the NHIS will be insolvent in 2013. Addressing the cost-inefficiencies of the pharmaceutical sector is essential for the future sustainability of the NHIS. The introduction of the health insurance scheme has made essential medicines affordable to over 62% of the population (80-95% of outpatient visits); they do not worry about medicine prices anymore. For the non-insured, large variations in retail price have been reported (up to 20 times the ex-factory price), sometimes because of large margins. No pricing policy is in place. Facility prices tend to drift towards the reimbursement price. The proportion of rich uninsured patients that are willing to pay extra for non-EML medicines is small (anecdotally, 2% has been mentioned; in urban areas the percentage may be higher). Policy objective To ensure the joint responsibility between government and consumers for a fair system of medicine financing, which will ensure universal access to essential medicines, including the vulnerable section of the population.

In order to improve access and specifically financial access, there have been several advocacy efforts towards removal of some of the taxes and tariffs, which inflate prices of medicines in Ghana over the years. Situational analysis These advocacy actions are informed by previous medicines price and availability surveys, which reveal duties, tariffs and markups significantly contributing to the final price of medicines (30-40% for taxes and tariffs, and 50-200% for markups). Thus, for a basic monthly treatment for peptic ulcer (using ranitidine 150mg twice a day for 30 days-60 tablets) in the Private Retail Pharmacy, the price would require 86.6 days\u2019 wages for an innovator brand treatment and 10.9"}

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 22 Clearly medicines prices could be considered high in Ghana; justifying efforts and interventions that seek to reduce medicines prices for out-of- pocket payments and health insurance payments. Price component studies have revealed the contributions to the final patient prices paid out-of-pocket payments or through health insurance payment models. Such studies have indicated that the manufacturers\u2019 component to the patient price ranged from 5.5 to 42.67% in the rural areas and 5-53.2% in urban areas. Also wholesalers contributed 14.1-55.42% in rural areas and 10.5-77.72% in urban areas. Retailers contributed 20.1- 74.99% in rural areas and 4.03-69.98% in urban areas. Importation typically added up to 36% to the ex-factory price of medicines. Port taxes and tariffs includes the following, import duty 10% of CIF, import VAT 12.5% of (CIF+import duty), import NHIL 2.5% of (CIF+import duty), ECOWAS levy 0.5% of CIF, Export Development Levy 0.5% of CIF, Interest Charges 0.5% of FOB, Network Charge 0.4% of FOB, Net Charge VAT+ NHIL, DGSL 1% of CIF, and GRA Tax Deposit 1% of CIF. Other fees include shipping line release fee, Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) rent and handling, clearing agent fees. The general observation of relatively high prices for medicines in Ghana was also true for child medicines. Meanwhile a comparison of medicines prices for children and adults revealed that prices of children\u2019s medicines were compared to the respective adult formulation. It is widely known that paediatric formulations are more expensive than adult formulations and this was also the case in Ghana. Co-trimoxazole syrup was 46% more expensive than the respective tablets, paracetamol syrup 22% and erythromycin syrup 13%.

Such exempted drugs shall be reviewed periodically, but not beyond two years. 3.2.9 Government shall exempt raw materials used for local pharmaceutical manufacturing from VAT on conditions to be determined by Parliament. 3.3 PROCUREMENT OF MEDICINES AND MEDICINE- RELATED HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES Preamble Procurement of safe, effective medicine of good quality is a complex process that needs standard procedures, dedicated professionals, good governance and full transparency of process and outcomes. In general, this can only be guaranteed by pooled procurement concentrated in a small number of large professional procurement agencies. Decentralized procurement always leads to higher prices and lower quality, and should be restricted to emergency procurements and small volumes only, from prequalified entities. The supply chain of health commodities must be guarded and protected for the sake of the entire public health system. Situation analysis Central procurement by the procurement units of the MOH and the Ghana Health Service is restricted to registered products. RMS and tertiary hospitals procure about half of the EMs themselves, mostly through private wholesalers; district hospitals probably procure about one quarter, from wholesalers and private pharmacies. They all assume that the products they procure are registered and approved. There are no survey data on the percentage of unregistered products in RMS and district hospitals. Teaching Hospitals occasionally import specialist drugs directly through medical representatives of the manufacturers. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 25 In recent years there is little general EM procurement due to decapitalization of CMS. RMS focus"}

Anecdotal information suggests that non- EML medicines are now only prescribed for non-insured patients \u2013 but these are increasingly few as most patients (60-95% of district hospital visits) are insured. There is no information whether RMS, TH and facility procurement follows FDA specifications. There is no central oversight on RMS and Tertiary Hospital procurement and distribution. There is no information flow between the RMS and CMS level. There is no inspection system for RMS facilities and performance. A national Health Commodity Supply Chain Master Plan has been developed in 2012, but has only partially been implemented (as at 2017). Occasionally the MOH monitors the quality of essential medicines in the public sector, but not often enough as only 1000 samples are tested per year. There are long quarantine times for medicines at CMS and RMS pending the central drug quality control, which is required but in practice often omitted. The MOH and the FDA have not been very clear about supply chain roles and responsibilities in relation to the oversight of medicine and medical supplies, especially for the latter. The Public Procurement Act of 2003, (Act 663) and (Act 914) as amended, designed for all government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies unintentionally created unnecessarily high procurement prices for clients of the MOH/GHS and for NHIA as an insurer by allowing all health facilities to conduct procurements locally from pharmaceutical suppliers.

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 33 CHAPTER 5 USE OF MEDICINES 5.1 RATIONAL USE OF MEDICINE Preamble The responsible use of medicines requires that people receive medicines appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their individual requirements for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and the community along with the requisite information. More than half of all prescribed, dispensed, sold and consumed medicines are inappropriate, leading to waste and undesirable health outcomes. About half of all patients do not take the medicines as prescribed. The combination of irrational prescribing and lack of patient adherence to treatment leads to undesirable health outcomes and considerable economic waste. The economic waste is of such magnitude that the sustainability of the NHIS is threatened. Situation analysis Professional bodies and training institutions use the EML and STG in their basic curricula. No medicine use information programmes are in place in the basic school curriculum. There is a National Drug Information Resource Centre (NDIRC), which produces a Medicines Information Handbook (MIH) as part of its work. The Centre has identified and trained drug information (DI) officers in the regions and this has gradually reduced queries for information on medicines at the national level. The Centre continues to support the DI services in the regions. The Center publishes a drug information journal but that has stopped since 2010 due to lack"}

The STGs are not always indicating first- and second-line choices (e.g. for diabetes and hypertension many possible treatments are listed, without indication of first priority or cost). A first national formulary of traditional remedies was also developed and published. A 2008 survey showed that 59.9% of public sector prescriptions use INNs. This is a reasonable percentage, in view of the fact that generic substitutions are allowed and practiced. The medicine use survey of 2008 also found that 87.5% of public sector prescriptions are based on the EML, 43.3% of public sector prescriptions contain one or more antibiotics and 13.3% of public sector prescriptions contain one or more injections. Especially the latter is a large improvement, as it used to be in the 50% range (the reduction is largely due to reduced use of chloroquine injection). There is no system of regular RUM surveys nor a dedicated national body to monitor use. Over half of the major hospitals do not have a Drugs and Therapeutic Committee in place; including some district hospitals. The level of functioning is not very well known. DTC guidelines were prepared and disseminated by the MOH. Some ad-hoc arrangements take place to redistribute unused medicines, but there is no systematic approach as there is no exchange of inventory information between facilities, RMS and CMS.

Patient safety practices include initiatives designed to reduce medication errors thus making health care safer for both clients and healthcare providers. Medication safety refers to freedom from accidental injury during the course of medication use. It includes activities to avoid, prevent or correct adverse drug events which may result from medication errors. Ensuring medication safety is related to professional practice, health care products, procedures and practices including prescribing, communication, product labelling, packaging, dispensing, distribution, sale, administration and education. Situation analysis Medication error and adverse drug reactions occur frequently leading to patient harm in the hospital setting. An earlier hospital study determined the rate of adverse drug events (medication errors or adverse drug reactions resulting in patient harm) to be 6.5 per 100 admissions of which 28% were preventable. A recent estimate also reveals that, on average, a hospital inpatient is subjected to at least one medication error per day. Substandard, spurious, falsified, falsely labelled, counterfeit medicines (SSFFCs) also have negative implications for patient safety. An estimated 25% of medicines consumed in resource limited countries are said to be counterfeit. Developing countries alone account for about 77% of all reported cases of SSFFCs. Access to quality medicines in Africa remains a challenge. A survey by WHO on quality antimalarial"}

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 40 Irrational use, non-adherence and non-compliance to treatments are also unsafe for patients. The overuse, underuse and misuse of medicines result in wastage of scarce resources and widespread health hazards. The most frequent cause of injuries due to medical care in hospitals is as a result of medication use. Policy objective The objective of this policy is to assure quality healthcare services through patient safety practices that protect people from undue harm. Policy statement 5.2.1 The Ministry of Health (MOH) shall ensure that patient safety practices are developed and maintained at all levels within the health sector. Patient safety practices shall be emphasized and integrated into all standing protocols, policies and guidelines operational in the health sector. 5.2.2 The MOH Quality Assurance and Patient Safety Policy shall be implemented to assure good health outcomes for patients. 5.3 DISPOSAL OF MEDICINES Preamble The disposal of expired and unused medical products needs careful management and supervision in order to protect the health worker, the population and the environment. Situation analysis The Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851) has specific provisions that mandate the FDA to ensure safe disposal of medicines [section 132 (2) (3) (4)]. FDA consequently has guidelines for safe disposal of medicines in line with international best practices. Policy objectives To ensure the safe disposal of medical waste including expired and unused National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 41 medical products. Policy statements 5.3.1 The disposal of medicines shall be undertaken in a manner that protects and preserves the environment and ensures that medicines due for disposal do not return into the population for use. 5.3.2 The FDA shall ensure in collaboration with other agencies where"}

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 42 CHAPTER 6 GLOBAL TRADE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 6.1 GLOBAL TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES Preamble Globalization and numerous international and bilateral trade agreements have a profound effect on pharmaceutical markets and prices. The effect is especially felt with newly-developed medicines which are still under patent and can be extremely expensive. Careful government policies are needed to strike the right balance between promoting innovation through protected intellectual property, and achieving universal access to newly developed essential medicines. Situational analysis The Government has issued administrative guidelines for taking advantage of Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities. Proof of concept has been given, as one compulsory license has been issued for parallel importation of an antiretroviral medicine. No TRIPS-plus provisions are enacted. Legal provisions for early development of generic medicines are in place. Policy objectives To maintain the balance between the minimum standard of intellectual property protection and public health good. Policy statements 6.1.1 In implementing regulations related to intellectual property rights, Government shall take advantage of all the safeguards National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 43 within the TRIPS Agreement to meet public health needs and promote access to pharmaceuticals and other health technologies. 6.1.2 Government shall not enact legislation, regulations or policies more stringent than the minimum requirements of the TRIPS Agreement. 6.1.3 The MOH shall actively collaborate with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Attorney General\u2019s Department and other relevant agencies in the area of intellectual property rights in developing consistent legal framework that enhances access to essential medicines and health technologies. 6.1.4 Parallel importation shall be promoted for pharmaceuticals and health technologies when the protection of the health of the public"}

National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 44 6.2 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Preamble Although significant knowledge about the pharmaceutical sector has accrued over the years, numerous questions still remain unanswered. Research capacity is needed to provide sound, scientific and reliable information to guide policy management and the practice of medicine use. The abundance of medicinal plants in Ghana requires a well coordinated and intensified research programme to identify, classify and document their uses and potency in the management of disease conditions in the country. Situation analysis Several promising clinical research projects are ongoing, but there is little oversight and coordination of the various efforts and no systematic approach to analyze and make use of the research findings. Policy objectives To promote and coordinate pharmaceutical research in all sectors to inform policies and practices in the pharmaceutical sector. Policy statements 6.2.1 There shall be a Pharmaceutical Research Platform to turn out information for updating pharmaceutical standards to international levels and speeding up production of medicines to meet access needs. 6.2.3 The Government shall support the development of"}

Policy objectives To promote the sustainable use of safe and effective herbal medicines of approved quality. Policy statements 6.3.1 The Ministry of Health and its agencies would maintain and upscale the pilot herbal medicine services units in selected hospitals into a multi-center, multi-disciplinary observation scheme for clinical trial and use of approved natural and herbal medicines that have passed the necessary quality assurance schemes. 6.3.2 The Ministry of Health and its relevant Agencies are to establish desk offices for health innovations and research with special reference to development and research of herbal and natural medicines. 6.3.3 The Herbal Medicine Industry shall promote sustainable cultivation of medicinal plant resources including plant tissue culture. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 47 CHAPTER 7 GOVERNANCE 7.1 GOOD GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY Preamble Challenges in the pharmaceutical sector often result, at least in part, from a lack of standard operational procedures and a lack of transparency. Such practices can waste resources, which reduce the availability of essential medicines and undermines the reputation of the health system. Good governance and transparency in government operations are increasingly expected and demanded by the public. Situation analysis There is a general lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical sector. For example, the list of products registered by the FDA is not readily available, there is limited transparency in the tender processes and publication of results. Procurement prices of most medicines in the public sector, as well as results of medicine quality tests are not published. Also, there are no regular surveys of medicine prices and availability in facilities, and no regular statistics on medicine use. For some functions"}

It also engages the general public and media through its multi-stakeholder engagement processes. It is not driven by the MOH. Policy objectives To promote cost-effective use of public resources through good governance, transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical sector. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 48 Policy statements 7.1.1 The Ministry of Health shall create and support an enabling environment for transparent processes and procedures within the pharmaceutical sector. 7.1.2 There shall be a central Management Information Systems (MIS) to enhance access to information on health technologies including pharmaceuticals. 7.1.3 There shall be adequate sharing of information to strengthen the capacity of consumers to demand accountability from providers with commensurate responsibility from consumers. 7.1.4 The Ministry of Health shall support the establishment of a multi- stakeholder platform to share information on the pharmaceutical sector. 7.2 RISK MANAGEMENT Preamble Risk management can be described as the culture, process and structures that are instituted to mitigate the consequences that will result from adverse effects of natural causes, human interferences, malfunctioning of equipment, appliances and other health system issues. Risk management in health systems is gaining prominence due to increasing awareness of the consequences of loss of critical health products and finances. Situation analysis Assessment of the sector has shown that there are risks throughout the supply chain. Key areas include lack of risk management policies and systems, weak risk assessment and mitigation measures, lack of fire detection system and firefighting equipment, among others. The intent of risk management policy is to ensure that risk management is approached in a holistic and comprehensive manner and embedded National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 49"}

Institutionalization of the risk management process as enunciated in the policy will provide opportunity for greater risk management success, reduce the probability of failure and ensure sustainable systems are maintained. Policy objective The overall objective of this policy is to embed risk management into the culture and operations of the health system so that risks to medical products, personnel and facilities are constantly identified, analyzed, managed and reduced to acceptable levels. Policy statements 7.2.1 The Ministry of Health shall be committed to protecting health products, facilities and personnel from the hazards of fire, explosions, theft, vandalism, natural catastrophes and environmental damage with the aim of achieving its goal of ensuring availability of medical products. 7.2.2 The risk management policy shall be implemented at all levels of the supply chain to anticipate and mitigate potential losses as well as implement preventive and corrective measures to reduce risks to acceptable levels. 7.3 HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FOR MEDICINES MANAGEMENT Preamble The presence and maintenance of dedicated professionally trained staff constitutes an essential component of the pharmaceutical system. While the ultimate goal is to have trained pharmacists in every health facility and medicines outlet, in the interim a good system of task-shifting and auxiliary personnel will be necessary to maintain a minimum level of service delivered through the right mix of skills. Situational analysis Several programmes of continuous professional education are ongoing. Scholarships have been given and there are many training opportunities in National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 50 drug management. Individual requests for study leave and opportunities are usually approved; but there is no systematic programme for career development. There are inadequate numbers and specialties of pharmacists in the public sector (MOH Staffing Norms, 2009). There were only 625 pharmacists in public service in 2016. There is no structural"}

Policy statements 7.3.1 Government shall ensure the establishment of staffing norms for the recruitment and deployment of the pharmacy workforce. 7.3.2 Government shall promote pharmacy workforce training institutions, geared towards meeting the requirements of the staffing norms. 7.3.3 Recruitment shall be based on the staffing needs of healthcare institutions, subject to transparent processes and national needs. 7.3.4 Distribution of the pharmacy workforce shall be equitable in line with the established staffing needs of all healthcare institutions. 7.3.5 Government shall ensure the retention of the pharmacy workforce by providing an enabling environment to minimize staff attrition. National Medicine Policy, 3rd Edition 2017 51 CHAPTER 8 IMPLEMENTATION 8.1 NATIONAL MEDICINE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION Preamble The national medicine policy needs a detailed policy implementation plan, in which all components of the policy are translated into concrete activities, preferably listed with baseline data, concrete targets, a time frame, cost estimate and responsible person or organization. The implementation of the policy needs to be coordinated and monitored by the Minister of Health. Situation analysis In the early years of the previous national medicine policy (2004-2006) there were ad-hoc coordination meetings, but there was no formal NMP coordination system in place. The MeTA Council focuses on improving transparency and good governance in the policy implementation process. Many activities have taken place, but coordination between the various stakeholders has been weak and no mid-term evaluation has taken place.
